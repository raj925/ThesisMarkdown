Having a PhD thesis completed is a weird position to be in. On one hand, this is very much a new beginning in my career and my professional life. On the other hand, reaching this stage feels like the culmination of many years of work and life experiences. I still have a lot to learn, which is very humbling. But getting to the end of something like this really forces me to take stock of where I am at and where I want to be at in future. I'm grateful to have experienced this kind of personal growth over the course of this DPhil, and will take it with me going forward. I would like to thank Wolfson College for providing financial support, as well as personal support for my time here at Oxford.

It really took a village to make this thesis a reality. There are a lot of people to thank, and some I may forget to mention, which in itself speaks to how lucky I have been to have had so much support around me. I would firstly like to thank my amazing supervisors, Nick and Helen, for their insights, enthusiasm and knowledge that helped shape this thesis into what it is. I have learnt so much from you both, and I will be forever grateful for that. I definitely feel like I have become a better researcher because of you both. Thank you for your patience and for being willing to help me on this journey, as well as just being good people. I could not have asked for better, more supportive supervisors.

I also want to thank everyone who was part of the OxSTaR group, it was wonderful to be part of such a supportive academic and clinical community. Thank you to Wendy, Rosie, James, Olivia, Will and Aditi for all your support. I want to particularly highlight those within the group who directly helped with my research, including Nathan, Kapil, Archie, Anil, Kaushila and Laura. Your inputs, feedback and help are so very appreciated! And I would like to thank Mo for his hard work. I have also been lucky to be a part of the ACCLab for several years, and to have met so many brilliant, smart folks. There are a lot of names to mention: Maja, Sarah, Aaron, the two Matts, Rebekka, Jasmine, Joshua. Thank you for your candour, your stimulating conversations and your friendship.

I am so grateful to have had friends in so many places I can rely on, especially for the (very needed) emotional support and for laughs! I could not have got this stage without such an amazing support system around me. In Oxford, I am thankful to have made friends for life. Thank you to The Crisps (Riddhi, Nilgoun and Samuel), Soyoung, Olly, Georgie, Malin. It's incredible to have such brilliant, funny and supportive people around me during this time. Outside of Oxford, I want to thank the Bath Lads (John, Matt, Robert and Gary) for your years of friendship and laughs, you mean a great deal to me.

And to the Foresters and Forester-adjacents! That means you Dom, Alessio, Dan, Ellen, Jesse, Connor, Will, Phil, Edwin, James, Nick and Tim! What a group to be a part of. It may not seem like it, but your friendships have helped me a lot over the course of this PhD. 

\
Last, and by no means least, I want to thank my family. My Akka, my Amma and my Appa (thank you for reading through my thesis). I do not have words to express and go through everything that you done for me (that would be another whole thesis to write, and I think that the one thesis was enough for me). For now, I will say that I love you all so very much and you share in this achievement with me, alongside my thathas and paatis, who I am at this stage because of. I miss them every day.

@article{bhise_errors_2017,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: With this study, we set out to identify missed opportunities in diagnosis of spinal epidural abscesses to outline areas for process improvement.
METHODS: Using a large national clinical data repository, we identified all patients with a new diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during 2013. Two physicians independently conducted retrospective chart reviews on 250 randomly selected patients and evaluated their records for red flags (eg, unexplained weight loss, neurological deficits, and fever) 90 days prior to diagnosis. Diagnostic errors were defined as missed opportunities to evaluate red flags in a timely or appropriate manner. Reviewers gathered information about process breakdowns related to patient factors, the patienteprovider encounter, test performance and interpretation, test follow-up and tracking, and the referral process. Reviewers also determined harm and time lag between red flags and definitive diagnoses.
RESULTS: Of 250 patients, 119 had a new diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess, 66 (55.5\%) of which experienced diagnostic error. Median time to diagnosis in error cases was 12 days, compared with 4 days in cases without error (P {\textless}.01). Red flags that were frequently not evaluated in error cases included unexplained fever (n ¼ 57; 86.4\%), focal neurological deficits with progressive or disabling symptoms (n ¼ 54; 81.8\%), and active infection (n ¼ 54; 81.8\%). Most errors involved breakdowns during the patienteprovider encounter (n ¼ 60; 90.1\%), including failures in information gathering/integration, and were associated with temporary harm (n ¼ 43; 65.2\%).
CONCLUSION: Despite wide availability of clinical data, errors in diagnosis of spinal epidural abscesses are common and involve inadequate history, physical examination, and test ordering. Solutions should include renewed attention to basic clinical skills.},

@article{baker_canadian_2004,
	abstract = {Background: Research into adverse events (AEs) has highlighted the need to improve patient safety. AEs are unintended injuries or complications resulting in death, disability or prolonged hospital stay that arise from health care management. We estimated the incidence of AEs among patients in Canadian acute care hospitals.
Methods: We randomly selected 1 teaching, 1 large community and 2 small community hospitals in each of 5 provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia) and reviewed a random sample of charts for nonpsychiatric, nonobstetric adult patients in each hospital for the fiscal year 2000. Trained reviewers screened all eligible charts, and physicians reviewed the positively screened charts to identify AEs and determine their preventability.
Results: At least 1 screening criterion was identified in 1527 (40.8\%) of 3745 charts. The physician reviewers identified AEs in 255 of the charts. After adjustment for the sampling strategy, the AE rate was 7.5 per 100 hospital admissions (95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.7-- 9.3). Among the patients with AEs, events judged to be preventable occurred in 36.9\% (95\% CI 32.0\%--41.8\%) and death in 20.8\% (95\% CI 7.8\%--33.8\%). Physician reviewers estimated that 1521 additional hospital days were associated with AEs. Although men and women experienced equal rates of AEs, patients who had AEs were significantly older than those who did not (mean age [and standard deviation] 64.9 [16.7] v. 62.0 [18.4] years; p = 0.016).
Interpretation: The overall incidence rate of AEs of 7.5\% in our study suggests that, of the almost 2.5 million annual hospital admissions in Canada similar to the type studied, about 185 000 are associated with an AE and close to 70 000 of these are potentially preventable.},

@article{wilson_analysis_1999,
	abstract = {Objective To examine the causes of adverse events (AEs) resulting from healthcare to assist in developing strategies to minimise preventable patient injury. Design Descriptions of the 2353 AEs previously reported by the Quality in Australian Health Care Study (QAHCS) were reviewed. A qualitative approach was used to develop categories for human error and for prevention strategies to minimise these errors. These categories were then used to classify the AEs identified in the QAHCS, and the results were analysed with previously reported preventability and outcome data. Results 34.6\% of the causes of AEs were categorised as ``a complication of, or the failure in, the technical performance of an indicated procedure or operation'', 15.8\% as ``the failure to synthesise, decide and/or act on available information'', 11.8\% as ``the failure to request or arrange an investigation, procedure or consultation'', and 10.9\% as ``a lack of care and attention or failure to attend the patient''. AEs in which the cause was cognitive failure were associated with higher preventability scores than those involving technical performance. The main prevention strategies identified were ``new, better, or better implemented policies or protocols'' (23.7\% of strategies), ``more or better formal quality monitoring or assurance processes'' (21.2\%), ``better education and training'' (19.2\%), and ``more consultation with other specialists or peers'' (10.2\%). Conclusion The causes of AEs or errors leading to AEs can be characterised, and human error is a prominent cause. Our study emphasises the need for designing safer systems for care which protect the patient from the inevitability of human error. These systems should provide new policies and protocols and technological support to aid the cognitive activities of clinicians.},

@article{schiff_diagnostic_2009,
	abstract = {Missed or delayed diagnoses are a common but understudied area in patient safety research. To better understand the types, causes, and prevention of such errors, we surveyed clinicians to solicit perceived cases of missed and delayed diagnoses.A 6-item written survey was administered at 20 grand rounds presentations across the United States and by mail at 2 collaborating institutions. Respondents were asked to report 3 cases of diagnostic errors and to describe their perceived causes, seriousness, and frequency.A total of 669 cases were reported by 310 clinicians from 22 institutions. After cases without diagnostic errors or lacking sufficient details were excluded, 583 remained. Of these, 162 errors (28\%) were rated as major, 241 (41\%) as moderate, and 180 (31\%) as minor or insignificant. The most common missed or delayed diagnoses were pulmonary embolism (26 cases [4.5\% of total]), drug reactions or overdose (26 cases [4.5\%]), lung cancer (23 cases [3.9\%]), colorectal cancer (19 cases [3.3\%]), acute coronary syndrome (18 cases [3.1\%]), breast cancer (18 cases [3.1\%]), and stroke (15 cases [2.6\%]). Errors occurred most frequently in the testing phase (failure to order, report, and follow-up laboratory results) (44\%), followed by clinician assessment errors (failure to consider and overweighing competing diagnosis) (32\%), history taking (10\%), physical examination (10\%), and referral or consultation errors and delays (3\%).Physicians readily recalled multiple cases of diagnostic errors and were willing to share their experiences. Using a new taxonomy tool and aggregating cases by diagnosis and error type revealed patterns of diagnostic failures that suggested areas for improvement. Systematic solicitation and analysis of such errors can identify potential preventive strategies.Arch Intern Med. 2009;169(20):1881-1887--{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The need is urgent to bring US health care costs into a sustainable range for both public and private payers. Commonly, programs to contain costs use cuts, such as reductions in payment levels, benefit structures, and eligibility. A less harmful strategy would reduce waste, not value-added care. The opportunity is immense. In just 6 categories of waste---overtreatment, failures of care coordination, failures in execution of care processes, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud and abuse---the sum of the lowest available estimates exceeds 20\% of total health care expenditures. The actual total may be far greater. The savings potentially achievable from systematic, comprehensive, and cooperative pursuit of even a fractional reduction in waste are far higher than from more direct and blunter cuts in care and coverage. The potential economic dislocations, however, are severe and require mitigation through careful transition strategies.},

The ``Preventing Overdiagnosis'' conference, hosted by The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, with sponsorship from consumer organizations, medical journals, and academic institutions, is evidence of an expanding interest in this topic. However, EM represents a compellingly unique environment, with increased decision density tied to high stakes for patients and providers with missed or delayed diagnoses in a professional atmosphere that does not tolerate mistakes. This article reviews the relevance of this reductionist paradigm to EM, provides a first-hand synopsis of the first ``Preventing Overdiagnosis'' conference, and assesses barriers to moving the concept of less test ordering to reality.},

We conducted a face-to-face survey of 122 general surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and anesthesiologists in three hospitals to evaluate the influence of several clinical and nonclinical factors on transfusion decision making. We found wide-spread deficiencies in physicians' knowledge of transfusion risks and indications. Each transfusion risk was estimated correctly by fewer than half of the physicians surveyed, and only 31\% responded correctly to a set of four questions regarding transfusion indications. Attending physicians routinely had lower knowledge scores than did residents, yet they exhibited more confidence in their knowledge. Residents' transfusion decisions, however, were strongly influenced by the desires of their attending physicians, resulting in their ordering potentially inappropriate transfusions. Of the residents surveyed, 61\% indicated that they ordered transfusions that they judged unnecessary at least once a month because a more senior physician suggested that they do so. These findings provide insights for the development of strategies to improve transfusion practices, which would address the dual concerns of quality of care and cost containment.(JAMA. 1990;264:471-475)},

Changes in the practice and business of medicine have caused some to question whether burnout among physicians and other healthcare providers may adversely affect patient outcomes. A clear consensus supports the contention that burnout affects patients, albeit with low-quality objective data. The psychological and physical impact on physicians and other providers is quite clear, however, and the impact on the physician workforce (where large shortages are projected) is yet another cause for concern. We have all heard the airplane safety announcement remind us to ``Please put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting others.'' Unfortunately, like many airline passengers (very few of whom use oxygen masks correctly when they are needed), physicians often do not recognize symptoms of burnout or depression, and even less often do they seek help.

Yet results are mixed when exploring biases applied to medical settings. Further, most studies have focused on the effect of a single bias on a decision choice, rather than on how various biases may interact in a complex decision-making process. We performed three preregistered experiments where trained medical students (∑N = 224) read hypothetical mental health patient descriptions. Participants explored follow-up information and made initial and adjusted diagnoses. We tested whether there was an anchoring bias of emphasizing the first-presented symptoms, whether there was a confirmation bias in selecting follow-up requests, and whether confidence increased during the decision process. We found that confidence increased for participants that did not change their decision or seek disconfirming information. There was some indication of confirmation bias in selecting follow-up requests. There was no indication that confirmation bias increased when confidence was high, and no support for the order of symptom presentation leading to an anchoring bias. We conclude that the biases are difficult to demonstrate for complex decision-making processes in applied medical settings.},

@article{van_den_berge_cognitive_2013,
	abstract = {Medical error poses an important healthcare burden and a challenge for physicians and policy makers worldwide. Diagnostic error accounts for a substantial fraction of all medical mistakes. Most diagnostic errors have been associated with flaws in clinical reasoning. Empirical evidence on the cognitive mechanisms underlying such flaws and effectiveness of strategies to counteract them is scarce. Recent experimental studies, reviewed in this article, have increased our understanding of the relationship between cognitive factors and diagnostic mistakes. These studies have explored the role of cognitive biases, such as confirmation and availability bias, in diagnostic mistakes. They have suggested that confirmation bias and availability bias may indeed cause diagnostic errors. The latter bias seems to be associated with non-analytical reasoning, and was neutralized by analytical, or reflective, reasoning. Although non-analytical reasoning is a hallmark of clinical expertise, reflective reasoning was shown to improve diagnoses when cases are complex. Research on cognitive diagnostic mistakes remains a quite novel line of investigation. Follow-up studies that shine more light on the cognitive roots of, and cure for, diagnostic errors are needed.},

@article{crowley_automated_2013,
	abstract = {The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to develop an automated, computer-based method to detect heuristics and biases as pathologists examine virtual slide cases, (2) to measure the frequency and distribution of heuristics and errors across three levels of training, and (3) to examine relationships of heuristics to biases, and biases to diagnostic errors. The authors conducted the study using a computer-based system to view and diagnose virtual slide cases. The software recorded participant responses throughout the diagnostic process, and automatically classified participant actions based on definitions of eight common heuristics and/or biases. The authors measured frequency of heuristic use and bias across three levels of training. Biases studied were detected at varying frequencies, with availability and search satisficing observed most frequently. There were few significant differences by level of training. For representativeness and anchoring, the heuristic was used appropriately as often or more often than it was used in biased judgment. Approximately half of the diagnostic errors were associated with one or more biases. We conclude that heuristic use and biases were observed among physicians at all levels of training using the virtual slide system, although their frequencies varied. The system can be employed to detect heuristic use and to test methods for decreasing diagnostic errors resulting from cognitive biases.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the relationship between physicians' diagnostic accuracy and their confidence in that accuracy.To evaluate how physicians' diagnostic calibration, defined as the relationship between diagnostic accuracy and confidence in that accuracy, changes with evolution of the diagnostic process and with increasing diagnostic difficulty of clinical case vignettes.We recruited general internists from an online physician community and asked them to diagnose 4 previously validated case vignettes of variable difficulty (2 easier; 2 more difficult). Cases were presented in a web-based format and divided into 4 sequential phases simulating diagnosis evolution: history, physical examination, general diagnostic testing data, and definitive diagnostic testing. After each phase, physicians recorded 1 to 3 differential diagnoses and corresponding judgments of confidence. Before being presented with definitive diagnostic data, physicians were asked to identify additional resources they would require to diagnose each case (ie, additional tests, second opinions, curbside consultations, referrals, and reference materials).Diagnostic accuracy (scored as 0 or 1), confidence in diagnostic accuracy (on a scale of 0-10), diagnostic calibration, and whether additional resources were requested (no or yes).A total of 118 physicians with broad geographical representation within the United States correctly diagnosed 55.3\% of easier and 5.8\% of more difficult cases (P \&lt; .001). Despite a large difference in diagnostic accuracy between easier and more difficult cases, the difference in confidence was relatively small (7.2 vs 6.4 out of 10, for easier and more difficult cases, respectively) (P \&lt; .001) and likely clinically insignificant. Overall, diagnostic calibration was worse for more difficult cases (P \&lt; .001) and characterized by overconfidence in accuracy. Higher confidence was related to decreased requests for additional diagnostic tests (P = .01); higher case difficulty was related to more requests for additional reference materials (P = .01).Our study suggests that physicians' level of confidence may be relatively insensitive to both diagnostic accuracy and case difficulty. This mismatch might prevent physicians from reexamining difficult cases where their diagnosis may be incorrect.},

@article{fleming_self-evaluation_2017,
	abstract = {People are often aware of their mistakes, and report levels of confidence in their choices that correlate with objective performance. These metacognitive assessments of decision quality are important for the guidance of behavior, particularly when external feedback is absent or sporadic. However, a computational framework that accounts for both confidence and error detection is lacking. In addition, accounts of dissociations between performance and metacognition have often relied on ad hoc assumptions, precluding a unified account of intact and impaired self-evaluation. Here we present a general Bayesian framework in which self-evaluation is cast as a ``second-order'' inference on a coupled but distinct decision system, computationally equivalent to inferring the performance of another actor. Second-order computation may ensue whenever there is a separation between internal states supporting decisions and confidence estimates over space and/or time. We contrast second-order computation against simpler first-order models in which the same internal state supports both decisions and confidence estimates. Through simulations we show that second-order computation provides a unified account of different types of self-evaluation often considered in separate literatures, such as confidence and error detection, and generates novel predictions about the contribution of one's own actions to metacognitive judgments. In addition, the model provides insight into why subjects' metacognition may sometimes be better or worse than task performance. We suggest that second-order computation may underpin self-evaluative judgments across a range of domains.},

The influence of a particular faction within a group was greater if its members were more confident. A participant's response accuracy was related to both greater confidence and greater influence to the extent that the task fell on the intellective end of the intellective--judgmental continuum of task types. As a result, the extent to which group members' confidence predicted their influence was also greatest on intellective rather than judgmental tasks. Results further illustrate that adding group members to work on a problem may increase overconfidence on judgmental tasks but decrease overconfidence on intellective tasks.},

@article{cheng_social_2021,
	abstract = {We propose and test the overconfidence transmission hypothesis, which predicts that individuals calibrate their self-assessments in response to the confidence others display in their social group. Six studies that deploy a mix of correlational and experimental methods support this hypothesis. Evidence indicates that individuals randomly assigned to collaborate in laboratory dyads converged on levels of overconfidence about their own performance rankings. In a controlled experimental context, observing overconfident peers causally increased an individual's degree of bias. The transmission effect persisted over time and across task domains, elevating overconfidence even days after initial exposure. In addition, overconfidence spread across indirect social ties (person to person to person), and transmission operated outside of reported awareness. However, individuals showed a selective in-group bias; overconfidence was acquired only when displayed by a member of one's in-group (and not out-group), consistent with theoretical notions of selective learning bias. Combined, these results advance understanding of the social factors that underlie interindividual differences in overconfidence and suggest that social transmission processes may be in part responsible for why local confidence norms emerge in groups, teams, and organizations.

An experiment is described in which observers were asked to decide which of two parallel lines was the longer, and to rate their confidence in each judgment. Each observer's set for speed or accuracy was manipulated over successive blocks of trials, and effects on response time, accuracy, and confidence were examined. Under an accuracy set, observers produced a higher percentage of correct responses, had longer response times, and made more confident judgments than under a set for speed. Within both speed and accuracy blocks, however, confidence ratings were inversely related to response time. The data on response accuracy, time, and confidence indicate certain deficiencies in either of the first two approaches, but were well accounted for by the third.},

We investigate the information on which these confidence judgments are based, and how they relate to the decision itself, by studying how fluctuations in perceptual information influence decisions and second-order metacognitive evaluations of confidence and accuracy. Human participants judged which of two dynamically changing stimuli contained more dots, under instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy. Crucially, stimuli remained visible for one second after the decision, before participants rated their confidence in their choice. We found that confidence and error detection depended on the balance of stimulus evidence accumulated in the periods both preceding and following the initial decision, regardless of whether instructions emphasized speed or accuracy. These findings suggest a shared computational basis for error detection and confidence judgments, with implications for current models of metacognitive evaluation of decision processes.

	abstract = {Empirical evidence indicates that people can provide accurate evaluations of their own thoughts and actions by means of both error detection and confidence judgments. This study investigates the foundations of these metacognitive abilities, specifically focusing on the relationship between confidence and error judgments in human perceptual decision making. Electroencephalography studies have identified the error positivity (Pe)---an event-related component observed following incorrect choices---as a robust neural index of participants' awareness of their errors in simple decision tasks. Here we assessed whether the Pe also varies in a graded way with participants' subjective ratings of decision confidence, as expressed on a 6-point scale after each trial of a dot count perceptual decision task. We observed clear, graded modulation of the Pe by confidence, with monotonic reduction in Pe amplitude associated with increasing confidence in the preceding choice. This effect was independent of objective accuracy. Multivariate decoding analyses indicated that neural markers of error detection were predictive of varying levels of confidence in correct decisions, including subtle shifts in high-confidence trials. These results suggest that shared mechanisms underlie two forms of metacognitive evaluation that are often treated separately, with consequent implications for current theories of their neurocognitive basis.},

Although several recent studies have found evidence against a strictly Bayesian account in the context of relatively complex tasks, the Bayesian confidence hypothesis remains dominant for simpler tasks. Here, we show that there is a basic behavioral signature that distinguishes Bayesian from distance-to-criterion models even for simple 2-choice tasks. We examined this signature in two experiments and found that both experiments exhibited behavioral signatures in line with distance-to-criterion computations but contrary to Bayesian ones. We further performed an extensive comparison of 32 models that implemented either Bayesian or distance-to-criterion confidence computations and systematically differed in their auxiliary assumptions. These model comparisons provided overwhelming support for the distance-to-criterion models over their Bayesian counterparts across all model variants and across both experiments. These observations challenge the Bayesian confidence hypothesis and instead suggest that humans use simple distance-to-criterion computations when judging confidence.},

	abstract = {Whether people change their mind after making a perceptual judgement may depend on how confident they are in their decision. Recently, it was shown that, when making perceptual judgements about stimuli containing high levels of `absolute evidence' (i.e., the overall magnitude of sensory evidence across choice options), people make less accurate decisions and are also slower to change their mind and correct their mistakes. Here we report two studies that investigated whether high levels of absolute evidence also lead to increased decision confidence. We used a luminance judgment task in which participants decided which of two dynamic, flickering stimuli was brighter. After making a decision, participants rated their confidence. We manipulated relative evidence (i.e., the mean luminance difference between the two stimuli) and absolute evidence (i.e., the summed luminance of the two stimuli). In the first experiment, we found that higher absolute evidence was associated with decreased decision accuracy but increased decision confidence. In the second experiment, we additionally manipulated the degree of luminance variability to assess whether the observed effects were due to differences in perceived evidence variability. We replicated the results of the first experiment but did not find substantial effects of luminance variability on confidence ratings. Our findings support the view that decisions and confidence judgements are based on partly dissociable sources of information, and suggest that decisions initially made with higher confidence may be more resistant to subsequent changes of mind.},

@article{rouault_psychiatric_2018,
	abstract = {Background
Distortions in metacognition---the ability to reflect on and control other cognitive processes---are thought to be characteristic of poor mental health. However, it remains unknown whether such shifts in self-evaluation are due to specific alterations in metacognition and/or a downstream consequence of changes in decision-making processes.
Methods
Using perceptual decision making as a model system, we employed a computational psychiatry approach to relate parameters governing both decision formation and metacognitive evaluation to self-reported transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in a large general population sample (N = 995).
Results
Variability in psychopathology was unrelated to either speed or accuracy of decision formation. In contrast, leveraging a dimensional approach, we revealed independent relationships between psychopathology and metacognition: a symptom dimension related to anxiety and depression was associated with lower confidence and heightened metacognitive efficiency, whereas a dimension characterizing compulsive behavior and intrusive thoughts was associated with higher confidence and lower metacognitive efficiency. Furthermore, we obtained a robust double dissociation---whereas psychiatric symptoms predicted changes in metacognition but not decision performance, age predicted changes in decision performance but not metacognition.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate a specific and pervasive link between metacognition and mental health. Our study bridges a gap between an emerging neuroscience of decision making and an understanding of metacognitive alterations in psychopathology.},

We propose that greater power increases the propensity to discount advice, and that a key mechanism explaining this effect is elevated confidence in one's judgment. We investigate the relationships across four studies: a field survey where working professionals rated their own power and confidence and were rated by coworkers on their level of advice taking; an advice taking task where power and confidence were self-reported; and two advice taking experiments where power was manipulated. Results consistently showed a negative relationship between power and advice taking, and evidence of mediation through confidence. The fourth study also revealed that higher power participants were less accurate in their final judgments. Power can thus exacerbate the tendency for people to overweight their own initial judgment, such that the most powerful decision makers can also be the least accurate.},

Intuitive thinkers, on the other hand, are aware only of the intuitive solution; whenever this solution is incorrect, they are unaware of how poor their performance was and how they rank in comparison to others.

Confidence was reduced with variable (vs. weak) evidence, even across conditions matched for difficulty. Building on this dissociation, we constructed a paradigm in which participants (N = 20) could choose to seek further information before making their decision. The data provided clear support for the hypothesis that subjective confidence predicts information seeking in decision making: Participants were more likely to sample additional information before giving a response in the condition with low confidence, despite matched accuracy. In a preregistered replication (N = 50), these findings were replicated with increased task difficulty levels.},

However, independence is unusual; people often discuss and collaborate in groups. When does group interaction improve vs. degrade judgment accuracy relative to averaging the group's initial, independent answers? Two large laboratory studies explored the effects of 969 face-to-face discussions on the judgment accuracy of 211 teams facing a range of numeric estimation problems from geographic distances to historical dates to stock prices. Although participants nearly always expected discussions to make their answers more accurate, the actual effects of group interaction on judgment accuracy were decidedly mixed. Importantly, a novel, group-level measure of collective confidence calibration robustly predicted when discussion helped or hurt accuracy relative to the group's initial independent estimates. When groups were collectively calibrated prior to discussion, with more accurate members being more confident in their own judgment and less accurate members less confident, subsequent group interactions were likelier to yield increased accuracy. We argue that collective calibration predicts improvement because groups typically listen to their most confident members. When confidence and knowledge are positively associated across group members, the group's most knowledgeable members are more likely to influence the group's answers.},

The literature on medical decision-making suggests that cognitive biases, or failures related to the way healthcare providers think, explain many diagnostic errors. This study investigates whether one cognitive bias, overconfidence, defined as the tendency to overestimate one's performance relative to others, is associated with the low quality of care provided in Senegal. We link survey data on the overconfidence of health workers to objective measures of the quality of care they provide to standardised patients -- enumerators who pose as real patients and record details of the consultation. We find that about a third of providers are overconfident -- meaning that they overestimate their own abilities relative to their peers. We then show that overconfident providers are 26\% less likely to manage patients correctly and exert less effort in clinical practice. These results suggest that the low levels of quality of care observed in some settings could be partly explained by the cognitive biases of providers, such as overconfidence. Policies that encourage adequate supervision and feedback to healthcare workers might reduce such failures in clinical decision-making.},

In each of three experiments, college students evaluated two fictional financial advisors who judged the likelihood that each of several stocks would increase in value. One of the advisors (the moderate advisor) was reasonably well calibrated and the other (the extreme advisor) was overconfident. In all three experiments, participants tended to prefer the extreme advisor. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the advisors' confidence influenced participants' perception of their knowledge, and Experiment 3 showed that it influenced their perception of the number of categorically correct judgments they made. Both of these variables were, in turn, related to participants' preferences. Experiment 3 also suggested that need for cognition and right-wing authoritarianism are positively related to preference for the extreme advisor. A quantitative model is presented, which captures the basic pattern of results. This model includes the assumption that people use a confidence heuristic; they assume that a more confident advisor makes more categorically correct judgments and is more knowledgeable.

	abstract = {The focus of diagnostic radiology training is on creating competent professionals, whereas confidence and its calibration receive less attention. Appropriate confidence is critical for patient care both during and after training. Overconfidence can adversely affect patient care and underconfidence can create excessive costs. We reviewed the psychology and medical literature pertaining to confidence and competence to collect insights and best practices from the psychology and medical literature on confidence and apply them to radiology training. People are rarely accurate in assessments of their own competence. Among physicians, the correlation between perceived abilities and external assessments of those abilities is weak. Overconfidence is more prevalent than underconfidence, particularly at lower levels of competence. On the individual level, confidence can be calibrated to a more appropriate level through efforts to increase competence, including sub-specialization, and by gaining a better understanding of metacognitive processes. With feedback, high-fidelity simulation has the potential to improve both competence and metacognition. On the system level, systems that facilitate access to follow-up imaging, pathology, and clinical outcomes can help close the gap between perceived and actual performance. Appropriate matching of trainee confidence and competence should be a goal of radiology residency and fellowship training to help mitigate the adverse effects of both overconfidence and underconfidence during training and independent practice.},

This paper is a report of a study of the relationship between nurses' clinical experience and calibration of their self-confidence and judgement accuracy for critical event risk assessment judgements. Background. Miscalibration (i.e. under-confidence or over-confidence of confidence levels) has an important impact on the quality of nursing care. Despite this, little is known about how nurses' subjective confidence is calibrated with the accuracy of their judgments. Methods. A sample of 103 nursing students and 34 experienced nurses were exposed to 25 risk assessment vignettes. For each vignette they made dichotomous judgements of whether the patient in each scenario was at risk of a critical event, and assigned confidence ratings (0--100) to their judgement calls. The clinical vignettes and judgement criteria were generated from real patient cases. The methodology of confidence calibration was used to calculate calibration measures and generate calibration curves. Data were collected between March 2007 and January 2008. Findings. Experienced nurses were statistically significantly more confident than students but no more accurate. Whilst students tended towards under-confidence, experienced nurses were over-confident. Experienced nurses were no more calibrated than students. Experienced nurses were no better at discriminating between correct and incorrect judgements than students. These patterns were exacerbated when nurses and students were extremely over-confident or extremely under-confident. Conclusion. Nurses were systematically biased towards over/under-confidence in their critical event risk assessment judgements. In particular, experienced nurses were no better calibrated than their student counterparts; with student under-confidence countered by experienced nurses' greater susceptibility to over-confidence.},

	abstract = {Background
There has been little use of simulation to investigate speaking-up behaviors in response to routine clinical errors. We designed a simulation-based intervention to study the communication skills of nursing students.
Methods
The content of debriefings was coded to identify the barriers, enablers, and strategies used to voice concerns in 17 groups. Questionnaires assessed students' attitudes before and after the simulation (N = 98).
Results
The most commonly perceived barriers were the students' status, the presence of the patient, and fear of consequences. Openness of the supervisor, risk assessment, and team familiarity were the most frequently mentioned enablers. The main strategy was asking na{\"\i}ve questions. Teamwork climate was rated lower after the simulation training.
Conclusion
Nursing students tend to remain silent or to use inefficient strategies in response to violations of standard precautions. The simulation session had an impact on nursing students' attitudes.},

	abstract = {No one likes to be wrong. Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper, we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.},

However, previous research has found that these metacognitive functions can vary greatly between individuals and can become maladaptively decoupled or decalibrated in psychiatric disorders. This thesis explores the relationship between confidence and information-seeking behaviour when making decisions under uncertainty, and individual differences in these measures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This work begins with the development of two decision tasks that provide parallel measures of confidence and information-seeking in the domains of perceptual judgment and probabilistic reasoning. I then investigate whether psychiatric dimensions of interest might be reliably associated with certain patterns of confidence and information-seeking. I present data showing that, while trait anxiety tended to be associated with a small underconfidence bias across domains, psychiatric dimensions on the whole fail to be consistently predictive of confidence or information-seeking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}I then proceed to explore specific aspects of confidence and information-seeking. While previous literature and preliminary findings had suggested that people might employ strategies other than information-seeking to manage uncertainty during decision-making, I present results suggesting that participants do not typically engage in time-effective strategies like seeking feedback or opting out of decisions, even when they are available as alternatives to information-seeking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}I then look more closely into the relationship between choice and confidence in the decision process. I report a robust increase in confidence at the point of decision, even after accounting for differences in the objective probability of being correct. After investigating possible mechanisms for this effect, I suggest that the act of committing to a decision evokes a boost in confidence, but that this decision-evoked confidence boost fails to have lasting effects on subsequent confidence, information-seeking, or choices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Overall, my results suggest that confidence and information-seeking generally help us make more adaptive decisions under uncertainty. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of the broader implications of the findings for psychiatric and cognitive research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In a masked orientation task with varying stimulus-onset-asynchrony, we used EEG and cognitive modelling to trace the timing of the neural correlates of confidence. Confidence reported by human observers increased with stimulus-onset-asynchrony in correct and to a lesser degree in incorrect trials, a pattern incompatible with established models of confidence. Electrophysiological activity was associated with confidence in two different time periods, namely 350--500 ​ms after stimulus onset and 250--350 ​ms after the response. Cognitive modelling revealed that only the activity following on the stimulus exhibited the same statistical regularities as confidence, while the statistical pattern of the activity following the response was incompatible with confidence. It is argued that electrophysiological markers of confidence and error awareness are at least in parts distinct.},

@article{rollwage_confidence_2020,
	abstract = {A prominent source of polarised and entrenched beliefs is confirmation bias, where evidence against one's position is selectively disregarded. This effect is most starkly evident when opposing parties are highly confident in their decisions. Here we combine human magnetoencephalography (MEG) with behavioural and neural modelling to identify alterations in post-decisional processing that contribute to the phenomenon of confirmation bias. We show that holding high confidence in a decision leads to a striking modulation of post-decision neural processing, such that integration of confirmatory evidence is amplified while disconfirmatory evidence processing is abolished. We conclude that confidence shapes a selective neural gating for choice-consistent information, reducing the likelihood of changes of mind on the basis of new information. A central role for confidence in shaping the fidelity of evidence accumulation indicates that metacognitive interventions may help ameliorate this pervasive cognitive bias.},

Recent models of individual and group decision-making suggest that subjective confidence judgments are a prime candidate in guiding the way people seek and integrate information from social sources. The present study investigates the way people choose and use advice as a function of the confidence in their decisions, using a perceptual decision task to carefully control the quality of participants' decisions and the advice provided. The results show that reported confidence guides the search for new information in accordance with probabilistic normative models. Moreover, large inter-individual differences were found, which strongly correlated with more traditional measures of metacognition. However, the extent to which participants used the advice they received deviated from what would be expected under a Bayesian update of confidence, and instead was characterised by heuristic-like strategies of categorically ignoring vs. accepting advice provided, again with substantial individual differences apparent in the relative dominance of these strategies.},

After reading each section of the case, judges answered a set of 25 questions involving personality judgments about the case. Results strongly supported the hypotheses. Accuracy did not increase significantly with increasing information, but confidence increased steadily and significantly. All judges except 2 became overconfident, most of them markedly so.

	abstract = {BackgroundMetacognition is a cognitive process that involves self-awareness of thinking, understanding, and performance. This study assesses pathologists' metacognition by examining the association between their diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels while interpreting skin and breast biopsies.DesignWe studied 187 pathologists from the Melanoma Pathology Study (M-Path) and 115 pathologists from the Breast Pathology Study (B-Path). We measured pathologists' metacognitive ability by examining the area under the curve (AUC), the area under each pathologist's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve summarizing the association between confidence and diagnostic accuracy. We investigated possible relationships between this AUC measure, referred to as metacognitive sensitivity, and pathologist attributes. We also assessed whether higher metacognitive sensitivity affected the association between diagnostic accuracy and a secondary diagnostic action such as requesting a second opinion.ResultsWe found no significant associations between pathologist clinical attributes and metacognitive AUC. However, we found that pathologists with higher AUC showed a stronger trend to request secondary diagnostic action for inaccurate diagnoses and not for accurate diagnoses compared with pathologists with lower AUC.LimitationsPathologists reported confidence in specific diagnostic terms, rather than the broader classes into which the diagnostic terms were later grouped to determine accuracy. In addition, while there is no gold standard for the correct diagnosis to determine the accuracy of pathologists' interpretations, our studies achieved a high-quality reference diagnosis by using the consensus diagnosis of 3 experienced pathologists.ConclusionsMetacognition can affect clinical decisions. If pathologists have self-awareness that their diagnosis may be inaccurate, they can request additional tests or second opinions, providing the opportunity to correct inaccurate diagnoses.Highlights*Metacognitive sensitivity varied across pathologists, with most showing higher sensitivity than expected by chance.*None of the demographic or clinical characteristics we examined was significantly associated with metacognitive sensitivity.*Pathologists with higher metacognitive sensitivity were more likely to request additional tests or second opinions for their inaccurate diagnoses.},

@article{kostopoulou_information_2012,
	abstract = {Background: Information distortion suggests that people change the evaluation of new information to support an emerging belief. The present study was designed to measure the extent to which physicians distort incoming medical information to support an emerging diagnosis. Design: Data were collected via an anonymous questionnaire. The experimental group (102 physicians) read 3 patient scenarios, each with 2 competing diagnoses. Physicians first read information that favored 1 of the 2 diagnoses (the ``steer''). They then rated a series of neutral cues that favored neither diagnosis. At each cue presentation, respondents rated the extent to which cues favored either diagnosis and updated the strength of their diagnostic belief. After the neutral cues in the third scenario, respondents rated cues that opposed the initial steer. A control group (36 physicians) rated all the cues in random order and not within scenarios, thus providing unbiased baseline ratings for calculating distortion in the experimental group. Results: Distortion was statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001) and was associated with the strength of belief in the leading diagnosis. Physicians with over 10 years in practice distorted less than their less experienced counterparts (X¯ = 1.04 v. X¯ = 1.78, P {\textless} 0.05). Having developed an initial diagnostic leaning consistent with the steer, 56\% of physicians remained committed to it after receiving the conflicting cues. Distortion was strongly associated with commitment to the steer (odds ratio, 1.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03--1.79; P = 0.03). Limitations: Physicians did not elicit information; therefore, the authors cannot estimate the size of distortion in tasks involving information search. Conclusions: Distortion could partly explain commitment of physicians to an early diagnosis. Both distortion and strength of initial diagnostic belief seem to decline after 10 years in family medicine.},

@article{hunt_approach-induced_2016,
	abstract = {Information sampling is often biased towards seeking evidence that confirms one's prior beliefs. Despite such biases being a pervasive feature of human behavior, their underlying causes remain unclear. Many accounts of these biases appeal to limitations of human hypothesis testing and cognition, de facto evoking notions of bounded rationality, but neglect more basic aspects of behavioral control. Here, we investigated a potential role for Pavlovian approach in biasing which information humans will choose to sample. We collected a large novel dataset from 32,445 human subjects, making over 3 million decisions, who played a gambling task designed to measure the latent causes and extent of information-sampling biases. We identified three novel approach-related biases, formalized by comparing subject behavior to a dynamic programming model of optimal information gathering. These biases reflected the amount of information sampled (``positive evidence approach''), the selection of which information to sample (``sampling the favorite''), and the interaction between information sampling and subsequent choices (``rejecting unsampled options''). The prevalence of all three biases was related to a Pavlovian approach-avoid parameter quantified within an entirely independent economic decision task. Our large dataset also revealed that individual differences in the amount of information gathered are a stable trait across multiple gameplays and can be related to demographic measures, including age and educational attainment. As well as revealing limitations in cognitive processing, our findings suggest information sampling biases reflect the expression of primitive, yet potentially ecologically adaptive, behavioral repertoires. One such behavior is sampling from options that will eventually be chosen, even when other sources of information are more pertinent for guiding future action.},

	abstract = {Examined strengths of belief in several competing hypotheses after the elimination of hypotheses from the original set under consideration. In 3 experiments, 180 undergraduates read murder mysteries, each containing a series of clues pertaining to a closed set of suspects. After each clue, Ss estimated the probability of guilt for each suspect. Some Ss were tutored to revise their judgments in accordance with probability theory, adjusting probabilities in such a way that they maintained a sum of 1.0 across the set of hypotheses. Untutored Ss, however, were poor intuitive probability theorists. When a suspect was eliminated, they tended not to revise probabilities for remaining suspects. Following any given clue, they also tended to adjust only the probability of 1 target suspect, resulting in a constantly changing sum of the probabilities. Ss seemed to be using an anchor-and-adjust strategy in revising their beliefs but treated each hypothesis as if it were independent of its alternatives.

	abstract = {A well-documented phenomenon in opinion-revision literature is subjects' failure to revise probability estimates for an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive hypotheses in a complementary manner. However, prior research has not addressed the question of whether such behavior simply represents a misunderstanding of mathematical rules, or whether it is a consequence of a cognitive representation of hypotheses that is at odds with the Bayesian notion of a set relationship. Two alternatives to the Bayesian representation, a belief system (Shafer, 1976) and a system of independent hypotheses, were proposed, and three experiments were conducted to examine cognitive representations of hypothesis sets in the testing of multiple competing hypotheses. Subjects were given brief murder mysteries to solve and allowed to request various types of information about the suspects; after having received each new piece of information, subjects rated each suspect's probability of being the murderer. Presence and timing of suspect eliminations were varied in the first two experiments; the final experiment involved the varying of percent-ages of clues that referred to more than one suspect (for example, all of the female suspects). The noncomplementarity of opinion revisions remained a strong phenomenon in all conditions. Information-search data refuted the idea that subjects represented hypotheses as Bayesian set; further study of the independent hypotheses theory and Shaferian belief functions as descriptive models is encouraged.},

	abstract = {Purpose Cognitive psychology research supports the notion that experts use mental frameworks or `schemes', both to organize knowledge in memory and to solve clinical problems. The central purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between problem-solving strategies and the likelihood of diagnostic success. Methods Think-aloud protocols were collected to determine the diagnostic reasoning used by experts and non-experts when attempting to diagnose clinical presentations in gastroenterology. Results Using logistic regression analysis, the study found that there is a relationship between diagnostic reasoning strategy and the likelihood of diagnostic success. Compared to hypothetico-deductive reasoning, the odds of diagnostic success were significantly greater when subjects used the diagnostic strategies of pattern recognition and scheme-inductive reasoning. Two other factors emerged as independent determinants of diagnostic success: expertise and clinical presentation. Not surprisingly, experts outperformed novices, while the content area of the clinical cases in each of the four clinical presentations demonstrated varying degrees of difficulty and thus diagnostic success. Conclusions These findings have significant implications for medical educators. It supports the introduction of `schemes' as a means of enhancing memory organization and improving diagnostic success.},

	abstract = {Background Over the past three decades multiple tools have been developed for the assessment of non-technical skills (NTS) in healthcare. This study was designed primarily to analyse how they have been designed and tested but also to consider guidance on how to select them.
Objectives To analyse the context of use, method of development, evidence of validity (including reliability) and usability of tools for the observer-based assessment of NTS in healthcare.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Search of electronic resources, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycNet, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Additional records identified through searching grey literature (OpenGrey, ProQuest, AHRQ, King's Fund, Health Foundation).
Study selection Studies of observer-based tools for NTS assessment in healthcare professionals (or undergraduates) were included if they: were available in English; published between January 1990 and March 2018; assessed two or more NTS; were designed for simulated or real clinical settings and had provided evidence of validity plus or minus usability. 11,101 articles were identified. After limits were applied, 576 were retrieved for evaluation and 118 articles included in this review.
Results One hundred and eighteen studies describing 76 tools for assessment of NTS in healthcare met the eligibility criteria. There was substantial variation in the method of design of the tools and the extent of validity, and usability testing. There was considerable overlap in the skills assessed, and the contexts of use of the tools.
Conclusion This study suggests a need for rationalisation and standardisation of the way we assess NTS in healthcare and greater consistency in how tools are developed and deployed.},

We have performed an analysis of medical training curricula to determine the extent to which different medical specialties set training objectives in NTS, and to seek trends in the prominence with which these skills feature.

All hospital-based medical, surgical and critical-care specialties were obtained in mid-2013, along with each curriculum's immediate predecessor (where available). The curricula were initially searched for the core keywords `non-technical skills', `situational awareness' and `human factors', as well as a list of secondary keywords (generated by a modified Delphi process) grouped under headings `task management', `team working', `situational awareness' and `decision making'.

	abstract = {Context Intuition and uncertainty are inescapable conditions of many instances of clinical decision- making. Under such conditions biases and heuristics may operate, distorting the decision-making process. Physicians and students are generally unaware of these influences. Purpose To review the extant literature regarding the role of uncertainty and intuition and associated biases on medical decision-making, to highlight the implications this holds for medical education. Content Using literature identified via Medline and Bioethicsline searches of the past 3 decades, this paper reviews the sources of uncertainty in clinical practice and the role of intuitive decision-making. A detailed description of associated heuristics and biases is provided, and linked with demonstrable examples from medical decision-making. Conclusions It is argued that although uncertainty can be reduced, it can never be completely eliminated from decision-making. Therefore most decision-making performed in medicine contains an irreducible intuitive element and is thus vulnerable to these biases and heuristics. Given that few medical curricula overtly address the process of medical decision-making, both medical students and physicians remain vulnerable to these effects on their own (and their patients') decision-making. Insight via education appears the major means in which to avoid distorting decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Background Risk aversion among junior doctors that manifests as greater intervention (ordering of tests, diagnostic procedures and so on) has been proposed as one of the possible causes for increased pressure in emergency departments (EDs). Here we tested the prediction that doctors with more experience would be more tolerant of uncertainty and therefore less risk-averse in decision making.
Methods In this cross-sectional, vignette-based study, doctors working in three EDs were asked to complete a questionnaire measuring experience (length of service in EDs), reactions to uncertainty (Gerrity et al, 1995) and risk aversion (responses about the appropriateness of patient management decisions).
Results Data from 90 doctors were analysed. Doctors had worked in the ED for between 5 weeks and 21 years. We found a large association between experience and risk aversion so that more experienced clinicians made less risk-averse decisions (r=0.47, p{\textless}0.001). We also found a large association between experience and reactions to uncertainty (r=−0.50, p{\textless}0.001), with more experienced doctors being much more at ease with uncertainty. Mediation analyses indicated that tolerance of uncertainty partially mediated the relationship between experience and lower risk aversion, explaining about a quarter of the effect.
Conclusion While we might be tempted to conclude from this research that experience and the ability to tolerate uncertainty lead to positive outcomes for patients (less risk-averse management strategies and higher levels of safety netting), what we are unable to conclude from this design is that these less risk-averse strategies improve patient safety.},

	abstract = {Rationale aims and objectives The available evidence on the use of heuristics and their relationship with diagnostic error in primary care is very limited. The aim of the study is to identify the use of unknown thought and specifically the possible use of Representativeness, Availability and overconfidence heuristics in the clinical practice of primary care physicians in cases of dyspnoea and to analyse their possible relationship with diagnostic error. Methods A total of 371 patients consulting with new episodes of dyspnoea in Primary Care centres in Spain were registered. Based on specific operational definitions, the use of unconscious thinking and the use of heuristics during the diagnostic process were assessed. Subsequently, the association between their use and diagnostic error was analysed. Results In 49.6\% of cases, the confirmatory diagnosis coincided with the first diagnostic impression, suggesting the use of the representativeness heuristic in the diagnostic decision process. In 82.3\% of the cases, the confirmatory diagnosis was among the three diagnostic hypotheses that were first identified by the general physicians, suggesting a possible use of the availability heuristic. In more than 50\% of the cases, the physicians were overconfident in the certainty of their own diagnosis. Finally, a diagnostic error was identified in 9.9\% of the recorded cases and no statistically significant correlation was found between the use of some unconscious thinking tools (such as the use of heuristics) and the diagnostic error. Conclusion Unconscious thinking manifested through the acceptance of the first diagnostic impression and the use of heuristics is commonly used by primary care physicians in the clinical decision process in the face of new episodes of dyspnoea; however, its influence on diagnostic error is not significant. The proposed explicit and reproducible methodology may inspire further studies to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to 1) help novice students scaffold problem-solving and engage safely in the deliberate practice of diagnostic reasoning and medical decision-making in real time; 2) assess how accurately students gather and apply data in medical reasoning and treatment during high-fidelity patient simulations (HFPSs); 3) identify students' scientific misconceptions related to the case; 4) promote student metacognitive processing, self-assessment, and self-efficacy; and 5) facilitate the explicit calibration of student confidence in deliberate reasoning with patient outcomes. In a mixed-method design, a metacognitive calibration self-assessing (MCC) survey tool was applied to HFPS (n = 80, 20 teams of 6 medical students) and semistructured interviews were conducted with faculty (n = 5). When scored by faculty with a rubric, the mean student accuracy ranged from 23\% to 74\%, whereas their self-assessment of confidence ranged from 71\% to 86\%. This result revealed overconfidence bias in novice students regarding the correctness of their wrong responses. The most common misconception identified was inverting cause and effect: metabolic acidosis was pointed to as the cause of the patient's problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus. The most common treatment error was overtreatment, with unnecessary added medication. Interviews with faculty suggested that the MCC tool improved the team process by slowing students down, requiring them to think through their answers, and that overall the tool improved their critical thinking. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a metacognitive confidence calibration tool to assist novice students in learning safely to make deliberate diagnostic reasoning and decisions on patient care in real time during complex simulations while observing objectively their levels of psychological confidence against patient outcomes. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates the feasibility of a metacognitive confidence calibration tool (MCC) to assess and promote novices in the learning of diagnostic reasoning and treatment decisions on patient care in real time during high-fidelity patient simulations while comparing confidence and accuracy data and identifying students' scientific misconceptions.

	abstract = {Studies in psychology and clinical decision making have shown that research subjects and physicians are often overconfident in the accuracy of their judgments. In these studies, groups of 20 first-year and 27 third-year osteopathic medical students at the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine (Athens) were slightly underconfident in their ability to classify artificially-generated abnormal heart rhythms, with good "calibration" at higher confidence levels. Evaluating individuals on "adjusted resolution," which provides an index of the ability to sort correct and incorrect diagnoses into different confidence levels, reveals a curvilinear relationship between diagnostic metacognition (adjusted resolution) and accuracy. The best metacognition was found in subjects  achieving 70 to 85 percent diagnostic accuracy. Implications of these findings are discussed. Three figures illustrate the discussion, and an appendix contains a diagram of the decomposition of mean probability scores. (SLD)},

	abstract = {Purpose 
          Although transparency is critical for reducing medical errors, physicians feel discomfort with disclosure. We explored whether overconfidence relates to physician's reluctance to admit that an error may have occurred.
          Method 
          At 3 university medical centers, a survey presented a clinical vignette of a girl with urinary infection and penicillin allergy to medical students and physicians, asking them to rate their level of confidence for each step of the diagnosis and management. After anaphylaxis develops after cephalosporin administration, respondents were asked about their willingness to admit that an error might have occurred and to rate their level of discomfort in doing so. We analyzed levels of confidence, accuracy, willingness to admit mistake, and discomfort.
          Results 
          Respondents reported high levels of confidence for their answers to the questions of diagnosis and management, even when wrong---indicating miscalibration of confidence and accuracy. Compared with students, physicians had significantly higher levels of confidence, lower accuracy, and lower willingness to admit mistake. Although most respondents agreed in principle that errors should be disclosed, in the presented case, significantly less agreed to admit that a mistake might have occurred or to say so explicitly to the family. An association was found between overconfidence and discomfort with disclosure.
          Conclusions 
          Our study shows overconfidence associated with clinician's training and with reluctance to admit mistake, suggesting a contributing role to the difficulty in leveraging safety events into quality improvement. Training physicians to have both knowledge and adequate self-doubt is an educational challenge.},

@article{levin_antimicrobial_2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, signs of infection and inflammation are similar, making diagnosis of bacterial infections difficult. Antimicrobials may therefore be overused, contributing to development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To measure the accuracy of clinician decisions to start antimicrobials; to correlate clinician certainty with the presence of infection; and to examine whether physiological variables correlate with clinician certainty. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Patients staying {\textgreater}48 hours in a general ICU of a tertiary care hospital. MEASUREMENTS: The ICU clinician's certainty for the presence of infection was recorded when starting antimicrobials. An independent infectious diseases (ID) specialist determined if antimicrobials were required and if infection was present. Clinician antibiotic start decisions were tested for accuracy according to the ID determination for the presence of infection. RESULTS: Empirical antimicrobial therapy was justified by the presence of infection on 67/125 (54\%) occasions. Clinician certainty for infection correlated well with the presence of defined infection (r2 = 0.78), however, infection was defined on 6/19 (31\%) occasions when ICU clinician certainty was low (≤2), and antimicrobials were prescribed even when clinician certainty was minimal. Antimicrobial course length was similar whether infection was defined or not (11.5 $\pm$ 9.2 vs 10.7 $\pm$ 9.1 days; P = 0.65). Physiological variables were not associated with clinician certainty of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial therapy is probably overused in the ICU, possibly resulting from difficulties in diagnosis and the perceived greater risk of untreated infection when compared to the risks of potentially unnecessary antimicrobial therapy. Efforts to improve antimicrobial-related decision-making should be mandatory. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2012. {\copyright} 2012 Society of Hospital Medicine.},

@article{calman_variability_1992,
	abstract = {This study was designed to determine the variability in the consultation practices of family physicians and family nurse practitioners in an urban group practice, and to examine the relation between the referring practitioner's diagnostic certainty at the time of the consultation request, the specificity of the request to the consultant, and the frequency with which the practitioner ordered consultations in that specialty.
This study examined consultations requested by six family physicians and two family nurse practitioners that were directed to nine medical and surgical specialties in connection with 35,218 family practice visits made over a 19-month period in an urban family practice. Requests for consultation were scored based on the level of certainty of the referring practitioner's diagnosis at the time of consultation and the specificity of the consultation request.
There was nearly a fivefold variation in the overall specialty consultation rates among providers, with even greater variation in each individual specialty area studied. Referral rate correlated positively with certainty of diagnosis (r = .40). There was no consistent relation between request specificity and referral rate.
Consultation rates vary widely, even among family physicians and nurse practitioners within the same practice. The rate at which a practitioner orders consultations in a specialty area increases in relation to the practitioner's certainty of the diagnosis at the time the consultation was requested. Diagnostic certainty is discussed as a possible indicator of a referring practitioner's knowledge in a specialty area, implying that the greater a practitioner's knowledge in a specialty area, the more he or she consults with specialists in the field. Financial incentives that attempt to decrease specialty consultation should be reexamined in light of these findings.},

	abstract = {Objectives 
          Hospitalized patients are at risk for diagnostic errors. Hospitalists caring for these patients are often multitasking when overseeing patient care. We aimed to measure hospitalist workload and understand its influences on diagnostic performance in a real-world clinical setting.
          Methods 
          We conducted a single-center, prospective, pilot observational study of hospitalists admitting new patients to the hospital. Hospitalists completed an abridged Mindful Attention Awareness Tool and a survey about diagnostic confidence at shift completion. Data on differential diagnoses and resource utilization (e.g., laboratory, imaging tests ordered, and consultations) were collected from the medical record. The number of admissions and paging volume per shift were used as separate proxies for shift busyness. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effects models (continuous outcomes) or mixed effects logistic regression (dichotomous outcomes).
          Results 
          Of the 53 hospitalists approached, 47 (89\%) agreed to participate; complete data were available for 37 unique hospitalists who admitted 160 unique patients. Increases in admissions (odds ratio, 1.99; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 3.82; P = 0.04) and pages (odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.21; P = 0.01) were associated with increased odds of hospitalists finding it ``difficult to focus on what is happening in the present.'' Increased pages was associated with a decrease in the number of listed differential diagnoses (coefficient, −0.02; 95\% CI, −0.04 to −0.003; P = 0.02).
          Conclusions 
          Evaluation of hospitalist busyness and its associations with factors that may influence diagnosis in a real-world environment was feasible and demonstrated important implications on physician focus and differential diagnosis.},

We tested the possibility of a bias toward an available single diagnosis in uncertain cases.DesignWe developed 5 different surveys providing a succinct description of a hypothetical individual patient scenaric. Each scenario was formulated in 2 versions randomized to participants, with the versions differing only in whether an alternative diagnosis was present or absent. The 5 scenarios were designed as separate tests of robustness using diverse cases, including a cautious scenario, a risky scenario, a sophisticated scenario, a validation scenario, and a comparative scenario (each survey containing only 1 version of 1 scenario). Participants included community members (n = 1104) and health care professionals (n = 200) who judged the chances of COVID infection in an individual patient.ResultsThe first scenario described a cautious patient and found a 47\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID when a flu diagnosis was present compared with absent (odds ratio = 0.53, 95\% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.94, P = 0.003). The second scenario described a less cautious patient and found a 70\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a flu diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.70, P {\textless} 0.001). The third was a more sophisticated scenario presented to medical professionals and found a 73\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a mononucleosis diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.27, 95\% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001). Two further scenarios---avoiding mention of population norms---replicated the results.LimitationsBrief hypothetical scenarios may overestimate the extent of bias in more complicated medical situations.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that an available simple diagnosis can lead individuals toward premature closure and a failure to fully consider additional severe diseases.Highlights*Occum's razor has been debated for centuries yet rarely subjected to experimental testing for evidence-based medicine.*This article offers direct evidence that people favor an available simple diagnosis, thereby neglecting to consider additional serious diseases.*The bias can lead individuals to mistakenly lower their judged likelihood of COVID or another disease when an alternate diagnosis is present.*This misconception over the laws of probability appears in judgments by community members and by health care workers.*The pitfall in reasoning extends to high-risk cases and is not easily attributed to information, incentives, or random chance.},

Thirty-one (N = 31) first- to fourth-year pathology and dermatology residents were randomly assigned to one of the two scaffolding conditions. The cases used in this study were selected from the domain of nodular and diffuse dermatitides. Both groups worked with a version of SlideTutor that provided immediate feedback on their actions for 2 h before proceeding to solve cases in either the Considering Alternatives or Playback condition. No immediate feedback was provided on actions performed by participants in the scaffolding mode. Measurements included learning gains (pre-test and post-test), as well as metacognitive performance, including Goodman--Kruskal Gamma correlation, bias, and discrimination. Results showed that participants in both conditions improved significantly in terms of their diagnostic scores from pre-test to post-test. More importantly, participants in the Considering Alternatives condition outperformed those in the Playback condition in the accuracy of their confidence judgments and the discrimination of the correctness of their assertions while solving cases. The results suggested that presenting participants with their diagnostic decision paths and highlighting correct and incorrect paths helps them to become more metacognitively accurate in their confidence judgments.},

@article{norman_etiology_2014,
	abstract = {Purpose 
          Diagnostic errors are thought to arise from cognitive biases associated with System 1 reasoning, which is rapid and unconscious. The primary hypothesis of this study was that the instruction to be slow and thorough will have no advantage in diagnostic accuracy over the instruction to proceed rapidly.
          Method 
          Participants were second-year residents who volunteered after they had taken the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) Qualifying Examination Part II. Participants were tested at three Canadian medical schools (McMaster, Ottawa, and McGill) in 2010 (n = 96) and 2011 (n = 108). The intervention consisted of 20 computer-based internal medicine cases, with instructions either (1) to be as quick as possible but not make mistakes (the Speed cohort, 2010), or (2) to be careful, thorough, and reflective (the Reflect cohort, 2011). The authors examined accuracy scores on the 20 cases, time taken to diagnose cases, and MCC examination performance.
          Results 
          Overall accuracy in the Speed condition was 44.5\%, and in the Reflect condition was 45.0\%; this was not significant. The Speed cohort took an average of 69 seconds per case versus 89 seconds for the Reflect cohort (P {\textless} .001). In both cohorts, cases diagnosed incorrectly took an average of 17 seconds longer than cases diagnosed correctly. Diagnostic accuracy was moderately correlated with performance on both written and problem-solving components of the MCC licensure examination and inversely correlated with time.
          Conclusions 
          The study demonstrates that simply encouraging slowing down and increasing attention to analytical thinking is insufficient to increase diagnostic accuracy.},

The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation---each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives---and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

	abstract = {Expert chess players, specialized in different openings, recalled positions and solved problems within and outside their area of specialization. While their general expertise was at a similar level, players performed better with stimuli from their area of specialization. The effect of specialization on both recall and problem solving was strong enough to override general expertise---players remembering positions and solving problems from their area of specialization performed at around the level of players 1 standard deviation (SD) above them in general skill. Their problem-solving strategy also changed depending on whether the problem was within their area of specialization. When it was, they searched more in depth and less in breadth; with problems outside their area of specialization, the reverse. The knowledge that comes from familiarity with a problem area is more important than general purpose strategies in determining how an expert will tackle it. These results demonstrate the link in experts between problem solving and memory of specific experiences and indicate that the search for context-independent general purpose problem-solving strategies to teach to future experts is unlikely to be successful.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic errors have been associated with bias in clinical reasoning. Empirical evidence on the cognitive mechanisms underlying biases and effectiveness of educational strategies to counteract them is lacking.To investigate whether recent experience with clinical problems provokes availability bias (overestimation of the likelihood of a diagnosis based on the ease with which it comes to mind) resulting in diagnostic errors and whether reflection (structured reanalysis of the case findings) counteracts this bias.Experimental study conducted in 2009 at the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, with 18 first-year and 18 second-year internal medicine residents. Participants first evaluated diagnoses of 6 clinical cases (phase 1). Subsequently, they diagnosed 8 different cases through nonanalytical reasoning, 4 of which had findings similar to previously evaluated cases but different diagnoses (phase 2). These 4 cases were subsequently diagnosed again through reflective reasoning (phase 3).Mean diagnostic accuracy scores (perfect score, 4.0) on cases solved with or without previous exposure to similar problems through nonanalytical (phase 2) or reflective (phase 3) reasoning and frequency that a potentially biased (ie, phase 1) diagnosis was given.There were no main effects, but there was a significant interaction effect between ``years of training'' and ``recent experiences with similar problems.'' Results consistent with an availability bias occurred for the second-year residents, who scored lower on the cases similar to those previously encountered (1.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.96) than on the other cases (2.19; 95\% CI, 1.73-2.66; P =.03). This pattern was not seen among the first-year residents (2.03; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.51 vs 1.42; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.92; P =.046). Second-year residents provided the phase 1 diagnosis more frequently for phase 2 cases they had previously encountered than for those they had not (mean frequency per resident, 1.44; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.96 vs 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.28-1.17; P =.04). A significant main effect of reasoning mode was found: reflection improved the diagnoses of the similar cases compared with nonanalytical reasoning for the second-year residents (2.03; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.57) and the first-year residents (2.31; 95\% CI, 1.89-2.73; P =.006).When faced with cases similar to previous ones and using nonanalytic reasoning, second-year residents made errors consistent with the availability bias. Subsequent application of diagnostic reflection tended to counter this bias; it improved diagnostic accuracy in both first- and second-year residents.},

	abstract = {Humans have the metacognitive ability to assess the accuracy of their decisions via confidence judgments. Several computational models of confidence have been developed but not enough has been done to compare these models, making it difficult to adjudicate between them. Here, we compare 14 popular models of confidence that make various assumptions, such as confidence being derived from postdecisional evidence, from positive (decision-congruent) evidence, from posterior probability computations, or from a separate decision-making system for metacognitive judgments. We fit all models to three large experiments in which subjects completed a basic perceptual task with confidence ratings. In Experiments 1 and 2, the best-fitting model was the lognormal meta noise (LogN) model, which postulates that confidence is selectively corrupted by signal-dependent noise. However, in Experiment 3, the positive evidence (PE) model provided the best fits. We evaluated a new model combining the two consistently best-performing models---LogN and the weighted evidence and visibility (WEV). The resulting model, which we call logWEV, outperformed its individual counterparts and the PE model across all data sets, offering a better, more generalizable explanation for these data. Parameter and model recovery analyses showed mostly good recoverability but with important exceptions carrying implications for our ability to discriminate between models. Finally, we evaluated each model's ability to explain different patterns in the data, which led to additional insight into their performances. These results comprehensively characterize the relative adequacy of current confidence models to fit data from basic perceptual tasks and highlight the most plausible mechanisms underlying confidence generation.

@article{tranfield_towards_2003,
	abstract = {Undertaking a review of the literature is an important part of any research project. The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge base. However, traditional `narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research. The paper highlights the challenges in developing an appropriate methodology.},

@article{gherman_neural_2015,
	abstract = {Choice confidence represents the degree of belief that one's actions are likely to be correct or rewarding and plays a critical role in optimizing our decisions. Despite progress in understanding the neurobiology of human perceptual decision-making, little is known about the representation of confidence. Importantly, it remains unclear whether confidence forms an integral part of the decision process itself or represents a purely post-decisional signal. To address this issue we employed a paradigm whereby on some trials, prior to indicating their decision, participants could opt-out of the task for a small but certain reward. This manipulation captured participants' confidence on individual trials and allowed us to discriminate between electroencephalographic signals associated with certain-vs.-uncertain trials. Discrimination increased gradually and peaked well before participants indicated their choice. These signals exhibited a temporal profile consistent with a process of evidence accumulation, culminating at time of peak discrimination. Moreover, trial-by-trial fluctuations in the accumulation rate of nominally identical stimuli were predictive of participants' likelihood to opt-out of the task, suggesting that confidence emerges from the decision process itself and is computed continuously as the process unfolds. Correspondingly, source reconstruction placed these signals in regions previously implicated in decision making, within the prefrontal and parietal cortices. Crucially, control analyses ensured that these results could not be explained by stimulus difficulty, lapses in attention or decision accuracy.},

@article{hautz_accuracy_2019,
	abstract = {Context The ability to self-monitor one's performance in clinical settings is a critical determinant of safe and effective practice. Various studies have shown this form of self-regulation to be more trustworthy than aggregate judgements (i.e. self-assessments) of one's capacity in a given domain. However, little is known regarding what cues inform learners' self-monitoring, which limits an informed exploration of interventions that might facilitate improvements in self-monitoring capacity. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of characteristics of the individual (e.g. ability) and characteristics of the problem (e.g. case difficulty) on the accuracy of self-monitoring by medical students. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 283 medical students from 5 years of study completed a computer-based clinical reasoning exercise. Confidence ratings were collected after completing each of six cases and the accuracy of self-monitoring was considered to be a function of confidence when the eventual answer was correct relative to when the eventual answer was incorrect. The magnitude of that difference was then explored as a function of year of seniority, gender, case difficulty and overall aptitude. Results Students demonstrated accurate self-monitoring by virtue of giving higher confidence ratings (57.3\%) and taking a shorter time to work through cases (25.6 seconds) when their answers were correct relative to when they were wrong (41.8\% and 52.0 seconds, respectively; p{\textless} 0.001 and d {\textgreater} 0.5 in both instances). Self-monitoring indices were related to student seniority and case difficulty, but not to overall ability or student gender. Conclusions This study suggests that the accuracy of self-monitoring is context specific, being heavily influenced by the struggles students experience with a particular case rather than reflecting a generic ability to know when one is right or wrong. That said, the apparent capacity to self-monitor increases developmentally because increasing experience provides a greater likelihood of success with presented problems.},

@article{mamede_role_2024,
	abstract = {Background Diagnostic errors have been attributed to reasoning flaws caused by cognitive biases. While experiments have shown bias to cause errors, physicians of similar expertise differed in susceptibility to bias. Resisting bias is often said to depend on engaging analytical reasoning, disregarding the influence of knowledge. We examined the role of knowledge and reasoning mode, indicated by diagnosis time and confidence, as predictors of susceptibility to anchoring bias. Anchoring bias occurs when physicians stick to an incorrect diagnosis triggered by early salient distracting features (SDF) despite subsequent conflicting information.
Methods Sixty-eight internal medicine residents from two Dutch university hospitals participated in a two-phase experiment. Phase 1: assessment of knowledge of discriminating features (ie, clinical findings that discriminate between lookalike diseases) for six diseases. Phase 2 (1 week later): diagnosis of six cases of these diseases. Each case had two versions differing exclusively in the presence/absence of SDF. Each participant diagnosed three cases with SDF (SDF+) and three without (SDF−). Participants were randomly allocated to case versions. Based on phase 1 assessment, participants were split into higher knowledge or lower knowledge groups. Main outcome measurements: frequency of diagnoses associated with SDF; time to diagnose; and confidence in diagnosis.
Results While both knowledge groups performed similarly on SDF- cases, higher knowledge physicians succumbed to anchoring bias less frequently than their lower knowledge counterparts on SDF+ cases (p=0.02). Overall, physicians spent more time (p{\textless}0.001) and had lower confidence (p=0.02) on SDF+ than SDF− cases (p{\textless}0.001). However, when diagnosing SDF+ cases, the groups did not differ in time (p=0.88) nor in confidence (p=0.96).
Conclusions Physicians apparently adopted a more analytical reasoning approach when presented with distracting features, indicated by increased time and lower confidence, trying to combat bias. Yet, extended deliberation alone did not explain the observed performance differences between knowledge groups. Success in mitigating anchoring bias was primarily predicted by knowledge of discriminating features of diagnoses.},

@article{hausmann_sensitivity_2019,
	abstract = {Background Multimorbidity can be defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions in one person. Within the diagnostic process, accurately detecting a multimorbid disease pattern still poses a major challenge for most physicians, and is known as a source of diagnostic uncertainty. Objective We investigated, how sensitive, confident, and accurate physicians are in diagnosing multimorbid versus monomorbid patients. Methods We created eight video case-based vignettes, which differed in type of morbidity (multimorbid versus monomorbid), field of medical specialization (somatic versus mental), and relatedness of underlying diseases (causally related versus unrelated). In total, 74 physicians (GPs, residents in an emergency department and psychiatrists) watched three to five randomly allocated video cases and had to generate suspected diagnoses at the end of each of three video sequences. Additionally, participating physicians rated subjective confidence for all mentioned diagnoses and for three sequences per case with the help of confidence profiles. Results Altogether, physicians made a large number of accurate diagnoses (69\%). Nevertheless, the overall number of underdiagnosed multimorbid cases (misses) was significantly higher (71\%) than over-diagnosed monomorbid cases (false alarms) (7\%). Discussion According to Signal Detection Theory, GPs and psychiatrists both showed lower detection performance for medical cases that lay beyond their own field of specialization. Remarkably, residents show the highest sensitivity for multimorbid cases with an approximately identically detection performance d' slightly over 1 for both field of medical specialization (somatic and mental). Furthermore, higher uncertainty in diagnosing multimorbid cases is related to lower confidence especially at the beginning of a diagnostic process, as well as to unrelated and therefore probably rare disease pattern. Several limitations of the study and the video case-based vignettes are described within the discussion section.

In particular, we examined what forms of cognitive engagement students used while diagnosing virtual patients and whether engagement forms predicted students' diagnostic confidence and efficacy. A total of 88 medical students from a large North American university voluntarily participated in this study. We used latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered statistical method, to identify groups of students with similar information processing patterns. Findings from this study revealed that students displayed various forms of cognitive engagement, i.e. recipience, resource management, and task-focused. Moreover, we found that group difference in diagnostic confidence was moderated by task complexity. In terms of diagnostic efficacy, students who were task-focused or resource managers did better than the recipience students. The findings advance our understanding of theories of cognitive engagement as well as inform the design of effective interventions in developing simulation-based learning environments.},

	abstract = {When physicians do not estimate their diagnostic accuracy correctly, i.e. show inaccurate diagnostic calibration, diagnostic errors or overtesting can occur. A previous study showed that physicians' diagnostic calibration for easy cases improved, after they received feedback on their previous diagnoses. We investigated whether diagnostic calibration would also improve from this feedback when cases were more difficult. Sixty-nine general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the feedback condition, they diagnosed a case, rated their confidence in their diagnosis, their invested mental effort, and case complexity, and then were shown the correct diagnosis (feedback). This was repeated for 12 cases. Participants in the control condition did the same without receiving feedback. We analysed calibration in terms of (1) absolute accuracy (absolute difference between diagnostic accuracy and confidence), and (2) bias (confidence minus diagnostic calibration). There was no difference between the conditions in the measurements of calibration (absolute accuracy, p = .204; bias, p = .176). Post-hoc analyses showed that on correctly diagnosed cases (on which participants are either accurate or underconfident), calibration in the feedback condition was less accurate than in the control condition, p = .013. This study shows that feedback on diagnostic performance did not improve physicians' calibration for more difficult cases. One explanation could be that participants were confronted with their mistakes and thereafter lowered their confidence ratings even if cases were diagnosed correctly. This shows how difficult it is to improve diagnostic calibration, which is important to prevent diagnostic errors or maltreatment.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic errors are a major, largely preventable, patient safety concern. Error interventions cannot feasibly be implemented for every patient that is seen. To identify cases at high risk of error, clinicians should have a good calibration between their perceived and actual accuracy. This experiment studied the impact of feedback on medical interns' calibration and diagnostic process. In a two-phase experiment, 125 medical interns from Dutch University Medical Centers were randomized to receive no feedback (control), feedback on their accuracy (performance feedback), or feedback with additional information on why a certain diagnosis was correct (information feedback) on 20 chest X-rays they diagnosed in a feedback phase. A test phase immediately followed this phase and had all interns diagnose an additional 10 X-rays without feedback. Outcome measures were confidence--accuracy calibration, diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and time to diagnose. Both feedback types improved overall confidence--accuracy calibration (R2No Feedback = 0.05, R2Performance Feedback = 0.12, R2Information Feedback = 0.19), in line with the individual improvements in diagnostic accuracy and confidence. We also report secondary analyses to examine how case difficulty affected calibration. Time to diagnose did not differ between conditions. Feedback improved interns' calibration. However, it is unclear whether this improvement reflects better confidence estimates or an improvement in accuracy. Future research should examine more experienced participants and non-visual specialties. Our results suggest that feedback is an effective intervention that could be beneficial as a tool to improve calibration, especially in cases that are not too difficult for learners.},

@article{soares_accuracy_2019,
	abstract = {Introduction
Interruptions in the emergency department (ED) are associated with clinical errors, yet are important when providing care to multiple patients. Screening triage electrocardiograms (ECG) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represent a critical interrupting task that emergency physicians (EP) frequently encounter. To address interruptions such as ECG interpretation, many EPs engage in task switching, pausing their primary task to address an interrupting task. The impact of task switching on clinical errors in interpreting screening ECGs for STEMI remains unknown.

Methods
Resident and attending EPs were invited to participate in a crossover simulation trial. Physicians first completed a task-switching simulation in which they viewed patient presentations interrupted by clinical tasks, including screening ECGs requiring immediate interpretation before resuming the patient presentation. Participants then completed an uninterrupted simulation in which patient presentations and clinical tasks were completed sequentially without interruption. The primary outcome was accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI during task switching and uninterrupted simulations.

Results
Thirty-five participants completed the study. We found no significant difference in accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI (task switching 0.89, uninterrupted 0.91, paired t-test p=0.21). Attending physician status (odds ratio [OR] [2.56], confidence interval [CI] [1.66--3.94], p{\textless}0.01) and inferior STEMI (OR [0.08], CI [0.04--0.14], p{\textless}0.01) were associated with increased and decreased odds of correct interpretation, respectively. Low self-reported confidence in interpretation was associated with decreased odds of correct interpretation in the task-switching simulation, but not in the uninterrupted simulation (interaction p=0.02).

Conclusion
In our simulation, task switching was not associated with overall accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI. However, odds of correct interpretation decreased with inferior STEMI ECGs and when participants self-reported low confidence when interrupted. Our study highlights opportunities to improve through focused ECG training, as well as self-identification of ``high-risk'' screening ECGs prone to error during interrupted clinical workflow.},

	abstract = {Objectives Diagnostic errors are a source of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, contextual factors influencing clinicians' diagnostic performance have not been studied in authentic ICU settings. We sought to determine the accuracy of ICU clinicians' diagnostic impressions and to characterize how various contextual factors, including self-reported stress levels and perceptions about the patient's prognosis and complexity, impact diagnostic accuracy. We also explored diagnostic calibration, i.e. the balance of accuracy and confidence, among ICU clinicians. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study in an academic medical ICU. Between June and August 2019, we interviewed ICU clinicians during routine care about their patients' diagnoses, their confidence, and other contextual factors. Subsequently, using adjudicated final diagnoses as the reference standard, two investigators independently rated clinicians' diagnostic accuracy and on each patient on a given day (``patient-day'') using 5-point Likert scales. We conducted analyses using both restrictive and conservative definitions of clinicians' accuracy based on the two reviewers' ratings of accuracy. Results We reviewed clinicians' responses for 464 unique patient-days, which included 255 total patients. Attending physicians had the greatest diagnostic accuracy (77--90 \%, rated as three or higher on 5-point Likert scale) followed by the team's primary fellow (73--88 \%). Attending physician and fellows were also least affected by contextual factors. Diagnostic calibration was greatest among ICU fellows. Conclusions Additional studies are needed to better understand how contextual factors influence different clinicians' diagnostic reasoning in the ICU.},

@article{mackenzie_magnetic_1996,
	abstract = {Objectives:
To quantify how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) influences clinicians' diagnoses, diagnostic confidence and management plans in patients with knee problems. To investigate whether these changes can bring about an improvement in health.
Methods:
This was a prospective observational study on all patients referred to a regional unit for MRI of the knee over a 6-month-period. Data on diagnosis, diagnostic confidence and proposed management before MRI was compared with diagnoses and actual management after MRI. In addition, short form 36 item (SF-36) health survey data was collected at referral and again 6 months later.
Results:
Three hundred and thirty-two patients were entered into the study. MRI led to previously unsuspected diagnoses in 69 of 269 patients with available data. When MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis, significant improvements in clinicians' diagnostic confidence were found (P {\textless} 0.01 for medial meniscus, P {\textless} 0.05 lateral meniscus, P {\textless} 0.05 anterior cruciate). MRI led to a change in management in 180 (63\%) of 288 patients (where data available). There was a significant shift away from surgical management after MRI (P {\textless} 0.01). SF-36 results were available in 206 patients. There was a significant improvement over time in five of the eight SF-36 scales (four at P {\textless} 0.001, one at P {\textless} 0.01).
Conclusions:
Magnetic resonance imaging significantly influences clinicians' diagnoses and management plans. These patients, examined by MRI, also recorded an improvement in health related quality of life.},

@article{albrechtsen_impact_2022,
	abstract = {Background
Recovery of consciousness is the most important survival factor in patients with acute brain injury and disorders of consciousness (DoC). Since most deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) occur after withdrawal of life-support, medical decision-making is crucial for acute DoC patients. Neuroimaging informs decision-making, yet the precise effects of MRI on decision-making in the ICU are poorly understood. We investigated the impact of brain MRI on prognostication, therapeutic decisions and physician confidence in ICU patients with DoC.
Methods
In this simulated decision-making study utilizing a prospective ICU cohort, a panel of neurocritical experts first reviewed clinical information (without MRI) from 75 acute DoC patients and made decisions about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Following review of the MRI, the panel then decided if the initial decisions needed revision. In parallel, a blinded neuroradiologist reassessed all neuroimaging.
Results
MRI led to changes in clinical management of 57 (76\%) of patients (Number-Needed-to-Test for any change: 1.32), including revised diagnoses (20\%), levels of care (21\%), diagnostic confidence (43\%) and prognostications (33\%). Decisions were revised more often with stroke than with other brain injuries (p = 0.02). However, although MRI revealed additional pathology in 81\%, this did not predict revised clinical decision-making (p-values ≥0.08).
Conclusion
MRI results changed decision-making in 3 of 4 ICU patients, but radiological findings were not predictive of clinical decision-making. This highlights the need to better understand the effects of neuroimaging on management decisions. How MRI influences decision-making in the ICU is an important avenue for research to improve acute DoC management.},

The objective of our study was to prospectively determine how CT affects physicians' diagnostic certainty and management decisions in the setting of patients with nontraumatic abdominal complaints presenting to the emergency department.SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We included 584 patients presenting with nontraumatic abdominal complaints to the emergency department from November 2006 through February 2008. Emergency department clinicians were prospectively surveyed both before abdominal CT (pre-CT) and after abdominal CT (post-CT) to determine the leading diagnosis, the diagnostic certainty, and the management decisions. Changes were assessed by Fisher's exact test and the log likelihood ratio.RESULTS. The most common diagnoses were renal colic (119/584, 20.4\%) and intestinal obstruction (80/584, 13.7\%). CT altered the leading diagnosis in 49\% of the patients (284/584, p {\textless} 0.00001) and increased mean physician diagnostic certainty from 70.5\% (pre-CT) to 92.2\% (post-CT) (p {\textless} 0.001; log likelihood ratio, 2.48). The management plan was changed by CT in 42\% (244/583) (p {\textless} 0.0001). Physicians planned to admit 75.3\% of the patients (440/584) to the hospital before CT; that plan was changed to hospital discharge with follow-up in 24.1\% of patients (106/440) after CT. Surgery was planned for 79 patients before CT, whereas hospital discharge was planned for 25.3\% of these patients (20/79) after CT.CONCLUSION. In the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with nontraumatic abdominal complaints, CT changes the leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic certainty, and changes potential patient management decisions.},

@article{harvey_evacuation_1999,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of evacuation proctography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven referring clinicians completed pre--evacuation proctography questionnaires for 50 patients, detailing diagnoses, confidence in these, intended management, and what they hoped to learn. After evacuation proctography, the radiology report was returned with a second questionnaire asking the diagnosis in the light of evacuation proctographic findings, their confidence, and what they had learned. Clinicians quantified management contribution and indicated how useful they found evacuation proctography in general. Results from pre-- and post--evacuation proctography questionnaires were compared to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Diagnostic confidence rose significantly after evacuation proctography (mean, 7.0 before evacuation proctography vs 8.4 after evacuation proctography; P {\textless} .001). Lead diagnosis changed in nine (18\%) patients. Intended surgical management became nonsurgical after evacuation proctography in seven (14\%) patients, and intended nonsurgical therapy became surgical in two (4\%). Surgery remained likely in 15 patients, but its nature changed in five (10\%). Five (10\%) clinicians stated that evacuation proctographic findings resolved diagnostic conflict, and nine (18\%) found that evacuation proctographic findings revealed unsuspected diagnoses. Clinicians found evacuation proctography of major benefit in 20 (40\%) cases studied and of moderate benefit in 20 (40\%). In general, 20 (43\%) clinicians found evacuation proctography very useful and 24 (51\%) found it moderately useful.

@article{sanger_diagnosing_2017,
	abstract = {Background
Postoperative surgical site infections (SSI) are common and costly. Most occur post discharge, and can result in potentially preventable readmission or unnecessary urgent evaluation. Mobile health approaches incorporating patient-generated wound photos are being implemented in an attempt to optimize triage and management. We assessed how adding wound photos to existing data sources modifies provider decision making.
Study Design
We used a web-based simulation survey using a convenience sample of providers with expertise in surgical infections. Participants viewed a range of scenarios, including surgical history, physical exam, and description of wound appearance. All participants reported SSI diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and management recommendations (main outcomes) first without, and then with, accompanying wound photos. At each step, participants ranked the most important features contributing to their decision.
Results
Eighty-three participants completed a median of 5 scenarios (interquartile range 4 to 7). Most participants were physicians in academic surgical specialties (n = 70 [84\%]). The addition of photos improved overall diagnostic accuracy from 67\% to 76\% (p {\textless} 0.001), and increased specificity from 77\% to 92\% (p {\textless} 0.001), but did not significantly increase sensitivity (55\% to 65\%; p = 0.16). Photos increased mean confidence in diagnosis from 5.9 of 10 to 7.4 of 10 (p {\textless} 0.001). Overtreatment recommendations decreased from 48\% to 16\% (p {\textless} 0.001), and undertreatment did not change (28\% to 23\%; p = 0.20) with the addition of photos.
Conclusions
The addition of wound photos to existing data as available via chart review and telephone consultation with patients significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence, and prevented proposed overtreatment in scenarios without SSI. Post-discharge mobile health technologies have the potential to facilitate patient-centered care, decrease costs, and improve clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the effect of computer-assisted interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) on diagnostic decision making by primary care physicians. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Primary care physicians' outpatient clinics in or near the Minneap olis/St. Paul metropolitan area. Participants. Forty family physicians and general internists who were members of either of two large consortia of clinics.  Intervention. Subjects evaluated ten clinical vignettes accompanied by ECGs and reported their diagnostic impressions. The vignettes were based on actual patient visits. Half of the subjects received ECGs with computer-generated reports, the other half received the same ECGs without reports. Main outcome measures. ECG reading time; agreement with the clinical diagnosis; agreement with the computer report; diagnostic confidence. Results. The subjects receiving the reports were more likely to agree with the clinical diagnoses of the original cases, particularly for two vignettes in which the diagnoses were uncommon and were mentioned in the reports. The subjects receiving the reports were also more likely to make diagnoses that were consistent with the reports, even when the reports were erroneous. Those receiving the reports spent, on average, 15 seconds less time looking at each ECG, a 25\% decrease. Conclusions. In simulated cases, primary care physicians appear to use computer interpre tations of ECGs when available, as shown by enhanced diagnostic accuracy and modestly reduced time spent reading the tracings. However, erroneous reports may mislead physi cians. Since the effects of computerized ECG interpretation do not appear to have been uniformly favorable in this mock-clinical setting, it will be important to evaluate the effects of this technology in actual practice. Key words: computer-assisted diagnosis; computer-as sisted decision making; physician decision making; electrocardiogram. (Med Decis Making 1995;15:107-112)},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examines how characteristics of clinical cases and physician users relate to the users' perceptions of the usefulness of the Quick Medical Reference (QMR) and their confidence in their diagnoses when supported by the decision support system.Methods: A national sample (N = 108) of 67 internists, 35 family physicians, and 6 other U.S. physicians used QMR to assist in the diagnosis of written clinical cases. Three sets of eight cases stratified by diagnostic difficulty and the potential of QMR to produce high-quality information were used. A 2 × 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test whether these factors were associated with perceived usefulness of QMR and physicians' diagnostic confidence after using QMR. Correlations were computed among physician characteristics, ratings of QMR usefulness, and physicians' confidence in their own diagnoses, and between usefulness or confidence and actual diagnostic performance.Results: The analyses showed that QMR was perceived to be significantly more useful (P \&lt; 0.05) on difficult cases, on cases where QMR could provide high-quality information, by non-board-certified physicians, and when diagnostic confidence was lower. Diagnostic confidence was higher when comfort with using certain QMR functions was higher. The ratings of usefulness or diagnostic confidence were not consistently correlated with diagnostic performance.Conclusions: The results suggest that users' diagnostic confidence and perceptions of QMR usefulness may be associated more with their need for decision support than with their actual diagnostic performance when using the system. Evaluators may fail to find a diagnostic decision support system useful if only easy cases are tested, if correct diagnoses are not in the system's knowledge base, or when only highly trained physicians use the system.},

@article{dreiseitl_physicians_2005,
	abstract = {Objective:
Clinical decision support systems are on the verge of becoming routine software tools in clinical settings. We investigate the question of how physicians react when faced with decision support suggestions that contradict their own diagnoses.
Methodology:
We used a study design involving 52 volunteer dermatologists who each rated the malignancy of 25 lesion images on an ordinal scale and gave a dichotomous excise/no excise recommendation for each lesion image. After seeing the system's rating and excise suggestions, the physicians could revise their initial recommendations.
Results:
We observed that in 24\% of the cases in which the physicians' diagnoses did not match those of the decision support system, the physicians changed their diagnoses. There was a slight but significant negative correlation between susceptibility to change and experience level of the physicians. Physicians were significantly less likely to follow the decision system's recommendations when they were confident of their initial diagnoses. No differences between the physicians' inclinations to following excise versus no excise recommendations could be observed.
Conclusion:
These results indicate that physicians are quite susceptible to accepting the recommendations of decision support systems, and that quality assurance and validation of such systems is therefore of paramount importance.},

	abstract = {Introduction Wrong and missed diagnoses contribute substantially to medical error. Can a prompt to generate alternative diagnoses (prompt) or a differential diagnosis checklist (DDXC) increase diagnostic accuracy? How do these interventions affect the diagnostic process and self-monitoring? Methods Advanced medical students (N = 90) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions to complete six computer-based patient cases: group 1 (prompt) was instructed to write down all diagnoses they considered while acquiring diagnostic test results and to finally rank them. Groups 2 and 3 received the same instruction plus a list of 17 differential diagnoses for the chief complaint of the patient. For half of the cases, the DDXC contained the correct diagnosis (DDXC+), and for the other half, it did not (DDXC−; counterbalanced). Group 4 (control) was only instructed to indicate their final diagnosis. Mixed-effects models were used to analyse results. Results Students using a DDXC that contained the correct diagnosis had better diagnostic accuracy, mean (standard deviation), 0.75 (0.44), compared to controls without a checklist, 0.49 (0.50), P {\textless} 0.001, but those using a DDXC that did not contain the correct diagnosis did slightly worse, 0.43 (0.50), P = 0.602. The number and relevance of diagnostic tests acquired were not affected by condition, nor was self-monitoring. However, participants spent more time on a case in the DDXC−, 4:20 min (2:36), P ≤ 0.001, and DDXC+ condition, 3:52 min (2:09), than in the control condition, 2:59 min (1:44), P ≤ 0.001. Discussion Being provided a list of possible diagnoses improves diagnostic accuracy compared with a prompt to create a differential diagnosis list, if the provided list contains the correct diagnosis. However, being provided a diagnosis list without the correct diagnosis did not improve and might have slightly reduced diagnostic accuracy. Interventions neither affected information gathering nor self-monitoring.},

@article{kourtidis_influences_2022,
	abstract = {Previous research has highlighted the importance of physicians' early hypotheses for their subsequent diagnostic decisions. It has also been shown that diagnostic accuracy improves when physicians are presented with a list of diagnostic suggestions to consider at the start of the clinical encounter. The psychological mechanisms underlying this improvement in accuracy are hypothesised. It is possible that the provision of diagnostic suggestions disrupts physicians' intuitive thinking and reduces their certainty in their initial diagnostic hypotheses. This may encourage them to seek more information before reaching a diagnostic conclusion, evaluate this information more objectively, and be more open to changing their initial hypotheses. Three online experiments explored the effects of early diagnostic suggestions, provided by a hypothetical decision aid, on different aspects of the diagnostic reasoning process. Family physicians assessed up to two patient scenarios with and without suggestions. We measured effects on certainty about the initial diagnosis, information search and evaluation, and frequency of diagnostic changes. We did not find a clear and consistent effect of suggestions and detected mainly non-significant trends, some in the expected direction. We also detected a potential biasing effect: when the most likely diagnosis was included in the list of suggestions (vs. not included), physicians who gave that diagnosis initially, tended to request less information, evaluate it as more supportive of their diagnosis, become more certain about it, and change it less frequently when encountering new but ambiguous information; in other words, they seemed to validate rather than question their initial hypothesis. We conclude that further research using different methodologies and more realistic experimental situations is required to uncover both the beneficial and biasing effects of early diagnostic suggestions.},

          Confidence is an important factor in decision making and may influence patient care.
          OBJECTIVES 
          To evaluate whether short-training-based dermoscopy increases confidence in the diagnosis of skin lesions.
          METHODS AND MATERIALS 
          After a 1-hour course on dermoscopy, 20 pairs of clinical and dermoscopic images of lesions were presented to 19 dermatology residents with little or no dermoscopy experience. After viewing the clinical image, they were asked to assess their confidence in the diagnosis in a seven-point scale, with 1 reflecting that the respondent was 100\% confident that the lesion was benign, while number 7 reflected 100\% confidence that it was malignant. The same technique was used for dermoscopic images.
          RESULTS 
          Ten of the 20 pairs of evaluations showed a significant difference (p{\textless}.05). The largest differences were observed in lesions where clinical scores suggested that participants were uncertain about the diagnosis, but tended to decide that the lesion was benign after dermoscopy. Dermoscopy did not improve confidence in the evaluation of dysplastic lesions as well as lesions with obvious clinical diagnoses.
          CONCLUSIONS 
          Short-training-based dermoscopy improved confidence in the diagnosis of clinically challenging skin lesions, but the impact was not demonstrable for clinically obvious lesions and dysplastic nevi.},

	abstract = {Deliberate reflection has been found to foster diagnostic accuracy on complex cases or under circumstances that tend to induce cognitive bias. However, it is unclear whether the procedure can also be learned and thereby autonomously applied when diagnosing future cases without instructions to reflect. We investigated whether general practice residents would learn the deliberate reflection procedure through `learning-by-teaching' and apply it to diagnose new cases. The study was a two-phase experiment. In the learning phase, 56 general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. They either (1) studied examples of deliberate reflection and then explained the procedure to a fictitious peer on video; or (2) solved cases without reflection (control). In the test phase, one to three weeks later, all participants diagnosed new cases while thinking aloud. The analysis of the test phase showed no significant differences between the conditions on any of the outcome measures (diagnostic accuracy, p = .263; time to diagnose, p = .598; mental effort ratings, p = .544; confidence ratings, p = .710; proportion of contradiction units (i.e. measure of deliberate reflection), p = .544). In contrast to findings on learning-by-teaching from other domains, teaching deliberate reflection to a fictitious peer, did not increase reflective reasoning when diagnosing future cases. Potential explanations that future research might address are that either residents in the experimental condition did not apply the learned deliberate reflection procedure in the test phase, or residents in the control condition also engaged in reflection.},

	abstract = {Pairs of hypothetical medical and non-medical problems were given to 44 pediatric residents at three levels of hospital training. Each problem was designed to detect a specific heuristic-based bias in making diagnoses. Discounting, disregarding base rate, and over-confidence in contextually embedded redundant information were more evident on medical than on non-medical problems. In particular, a greater number of third-year residents disregarded base-rate information than did first- and second-year residents on medical but not on non-medical problems. On medical problems, a greater number of first-year residents expressed greater confidence in redundant information that was contextually embedded than in information that was presented in a listed format. Over one-third of the residents confused prospective and retrospective probabilities; three-fourths showed evidence of augmentation; virtually all residents expressed greater confidence in a diagnosis based on redundant rather than on non-redundant listed information. These latter effects were consistent across training level and occurred on both medical and non-medical problems. The results are discussed in terms of prototype theory and the nature of medical training.},

It remains unclear, however, whether EHR indeed fulfills this claim under the severe time constraints of Emergency Departments (EDs). We assessed whether accessing EHR in an ED actually improves decision-making by clinicians. A simulated ED environment was created at the Israel Center for Medical Simulation (MSR). Four different actors were trained to simulate four specific complaints and behavior and `consulted' 26 volunteer ED physicians. Each physician treated half of the cases (randomly) with access to EHR, and their medical decisions were compared to those where the physicians had no access to EHR. Comparison of diagnostic accuracy with and without access showed that accessing the EHR led to an increase in the quality of the clinical decisions. Physicians accessing EHR were more highly informed and thus made more accurate decisions. The percentage of correct diagnoses was higher and these physicians were more confident in their diagnoses and made their decisions faster.},

@article{fawver_seeing_2020,
	abstract = {A substantial number of medical errors in radiology are attributed to failures of perception or decision making, although it is believed that experience (or expertise) might buffer diagnosticians from some types of perceptual-cognitive bias. We examined how the quality of contextual information influences decision making and how underlying perceptual-cognitive processes change as a function of experience and diagnostic accuracy. Twenty-one radiologists dictated their findings on 16 deidentified musculoskeletal radiographic cases while wearing a mobile-eye tracking system. Patient histories were mismatched on a subset of cases to be miscued relative to the correct diagnosis. Experienced radiologists outperformed less-experienced participants, but no systematic differences in gaze behaviors emerged between groups. Miscued case notes increased perceptual-cognitive bias in both groups, resulting in an approximate 40\% decrease in diagnostic accuracy. Most errors were judgment errors, meaning participants visually fixated on the abnormality for longer than a second yet still failed to make the correct diagnosis. Findings suggest a physician's confidence in their diagnosis might be misplaced after spending insufficient time extracting relevant information from key areas of the visual display, or when decisions are based primarily on a priori expectations derived from patient histories.

@article{krupat_avoiding_2017,
	abstract = {Context Early studies suggested that experienced clinicians simply generate more accurate diagnoses than those less experienced. However, more recent studies indicate that experienced clinicians may be subject to biases in formulating and confirming hypotheses that lead to inaccuracy. Objectives The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with the ability to process information in ways that overcome premature closure and result in accurate diagnosis using a set of vignettes in which inconsistent information was introduced midway. Methods Seventy-five participants (25 Year 3 medical students, 25 internal medicine residents in their second year of residency and 25 internal medicine faculty) were recruited to solve each of four complex clinical vignettes. In each vignette, the first four rounds of information pointed toward a narrowing range of diagnostic possibilities, but patient information presented in and after the fifth round was inconsistent with prior findings. In addition to accuracy, outcome measures were length of differential diagnosis, certainty of diagnosis, persistence in data collection and tendency to switch diagnoses. Results There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy across the three groups, each of which differed in level of training. However, across experience levels, diagnostic accuracy was associated with the mean number of items in the differential, tendency to persist (e.g. to request a greater number of rounds of information), and openness to switch (e.g. to change the most likely diagnosis on receipt of disconfirming information). Conclusions Level of training (i.e. clinical experience) was not associated with accuracy on this task. As faculty clinicians certainly have more knowledge than their junior counterparts, it is important to identify ways in which cognitive factors can lead to more or less persistence and openness, and to teach clinicians how to overcome tendencies associated with error.},

To identify common characteristics of diseases that GPs may misdiagnose.Methods. Systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for primary research on diagnostic error/delay in primary care. Papers on system errors, patient delay, case reports, reviews, opinion pieces, studies not based on actual cases and studies not using a systematic sample were excluded from the review. Twenty-one papers were included. All papers were assessed for quality using the GRADE system. Common features were identified across diseases and presentations that made diagnosis difficult and led to error/delay.Results. Most studies were retrospective cohorts of patients recruited in hospital and collected data from patient interviews and/or hospital records, resulting in incomplete and potentially biased information. It was usually not possible to determine preventability of the delay. Some conditions were extremely rare, suggesting a specialist research interest rather than an increased rate of misdiagnosis. Conditions investigated were malignancies, myocardial infarction, meningitis, dementia, iron deficiency anaemia, asthma, tremor in the elderly and HIV. Common features of difficulty were atypical presentations, non-specific presentations, very low prevalence, the presence of co-morbidity and perceptual features and could be missed.Conclusions. Misdiagnosis in primary care covers a wide range of conditions that may be related in the manner in which they present.

@article{graber_cognitive_2012,
	abstract = {Background Errors in clinical reasoning occur in most cases in which the diagnosis is missed, delayed or wrong. The goal of this review was to identify interventions that might reduce the likelihood of these cognitive errors.
Design We searched PubMed and other medical and non-medical databases and identified additional literature through references from the initial data set and suggestions from subject matter experts. Articles were included if they either suggested a possible intervention or formally evaluated an intervention and excluded if they focused solely on improving diagnostic tests or provider satisfaction.
Results We identified 141 articles for full review, 42 reporting tested interventions to reduce the likelihood of cognitive errors, 100 containing suggestions, and one article with both suggested and tested interventions. Articles were classified into three categories: (1) Interventions to improve knowledge and experience, such as simulation-based training, improved feedback and education focused on a single disease; (2) Interventions to improve clinical reasoning and decision-making skills, such as reflective practice and active metacognitive review; and (3) Interventions that provide cognitive `help' that included use of electronic records and integrated decision support, informaticians and facilitating access to information, second opinions and specialists.
Conclusions We identified a wide range of possible approaches to reduce cognitive errors in diagnosis. Not all the suggestions have been tested, and of those that have, the evaluations typically involved trainees in artificial settings, making it difficult to extrapolate the results to actual practice. Future progress in this area will require methodological refinements in outcome evaluation and rigorously evaluating interventions already suggested, many of which are well conceptualised and widely endorsed.},

Increasingly, however, they are being cast in the role of active decision makers in healthcare by policy makers and other members of the healthcare team. In the UK, for example, the Chief Nursing Officer recently outlined 10 key tasks for nurses as part of the National Health Service's modernisation agenda and the breaking down of artificial boundaries between medicine and nursing.1 As well, nurses are expected to access, appraise, and incorporate research evidence into their professional judgment and clinical decision making.2 This active engagement with research evidence is the focus of this paper. We will explore why it is necessary to consider the clinical decision making context when examining the ways in which nurses engage with research based information. We will also consider the relation between the accessibility and usefulness of information from different sources and the decisions to which such information is applied. Finally, we will argue that if we are to encourage nurses to actively engage with research evidence during clinical decision making, we need to better understand the relation between the decisions that nurses make and the knowledge that informs them.

In this paper, we draw heavily on the findings of 2 major studies conducted at the University of York between 1997 and 2002.3--,9 2 case studies were conducted in 3 geographical areas with different hospital types, population characteristics, and levels of health service provision.

@article{dunlosky_strengthening_2013,
	abstract = {Before the "big test" did you use the following study strategies: highlighting, rereading, and cramming? As students many of us probably did, yet research shows that while these three strategies are commonly used, they have been ineffective in retaining information. Learning strategies have been discussed in almost every textbook on educational psychology, so many teachers likely have been introduced to at least some of them, but, given the demands of day-to-day teaching, teachers do not always have time to figure out which strategies are best to use. Dunlosky reports that in his years of research he has discovered learning strategies that have proved successful and should be part of the "Student Toolbox" to boost learning. This article presents ten learning strategies for students and then expands on their usage. They are: (1) Practice testing: self-testing or taking practice tests on to-be-learned material; (2) Distributed practice: implementing a schedule of practice that spreads out study activities over time; (3) Interleaved practice: implementing a schedule of practice that mixes different kinds of problems, or a schedule of study that mixes different kinds of material, within a single study session; (4) Elaborative interrogation: generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true; (5) Self-explanation: explaining how new information is related to known information, or explaining steps taken during problem solving; (6) Rereading: restudying text material again after an initial reading; (7) Highlighting and underlining: marking potentially important portions of to-be-learned materials while reading.; (8) Summarization: writing summaries (of various lengths) of to-be-learned texts; (9) Keyword mnemonic: using keywords and mental imagery to associate verbal materials; and (10) Imagery for text: attempting to form mental images of text materials while reading or listening. Using learning strategies can increase student understanding and achievement, but are only effective if students are motivated to use them correctly. Teaching students how to guide their learning of content using effective strategies will allow them to successfully learn throughout their lifetime.},

Drawing on research in cognitive psychology and our experience as educators, we provide suggestions about how students should approach taking a course in college. We discuss time management techniques, identify the ineffective study strategies students often use, and suggest more effective strategies based on research in the lab and the classroom. In particular, we advise students to space their study sessions on a topic and to quiz themselves, as well as using other active learning strategies while reading. Our goal was to provide a framework for students to succeed in college classes.},

In particular, our results indicate that decisions (based on high and low, but not intermediate levels of uncertainty) made under stress (confirmed by skin conductance measures) are associated with increased confidence when outcome probabilities are incompletely known (20\% residual uncertainty). A different pattern was found when outcome probabilities were completely known (0\% residual uncertainty). Here, stress led to decreased decision confidence when decisions were associated with intermediate levels of uncertainty but had no effect in case of high and low levels of uncertainty. In addition we provide evidence for ambiguity---(understood as implicit-risk) assessment being impaired under stress conditions.},

The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a supplement.Simulation is a versatile technique used in a variety of health care settings for a variety of purposes, but the extent to which simulation may improve patient safety remains unknown. This systematic review examined evidence on the effects of simulation techniques on patient safety outcomes. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched from their beginning to 31 October 2012 to identify relevant studies. A single reviewer screened 913 abstracts and selected and abstracted data from 38 studies that reported outcomes during care of real patients after patient-, team-, or system-level simulation interventions. Studies varied widely in the quality of methodological design and description of simulation activities, but in general, simulation interventions improved the technical performance of individual clinicians and teams during critical events and complex procedures. Limited evidence suggested improvements in patient outcomes attributable to simulation exercises at the health system level. Future studies would benefit from standardized reporting of simulation components and identification of robust patient safety targets.},

@article{mahmoodi_equality_2015,
	abstract = {We tend to think that everyone deserves an equal say in a debate. This seemingly innocuous assumption can be damaging when we make decisions together as part of a group. To make optimal decisions, group members should weight their differing opinions according to how competent they are relative to one another; whenever they differ in competence, an equal weighting is suboptimal. Here, we asked how people deal with individual differences in competence in the context of a collective perceptual decision-making task. We developed a metric for estimating how participants weight their partner's opinion relative to their own and compared this weighting to an optimal benchmark. Replicated across three countries (Denmark, Iran, and China), we show that participants assigned nearly equal weights to each other's opinions regardless of true differences in their competence---even when informed by explicit feedback about their competence gap or under monetary incentives to maximize collective accuracy. This equality bias, whereby people behave as if they are as good or as bad as their partner, is particularly costly for a group when a competence gap separates its members.},

Results show that even though groups could have produced unbiased composites of the candidates through discussion, they decided in favor of the candidate initially preferred by a plurality rather than the most favorable candidate. Group members' pre- and postdiscussion recall of candidate attributes indicated that discussion tended to perpetuate, not to correct, members' distorted pictures of the candidates. It is suggested that unstructured discussion in the face of a consensus requirement may fail as a means of combining unique informational resources.

The present experiment uses newly developed methods for highly controlled manipulations of stress, and newly designed measurements of risk-taking in a complex combat simulation. Results of this research indicated that high levels of acute stress may lead individuals to be overconfident in their SA and take more risks. Results are discussed in terms of their importance for individuals who require adequate SA in order to perform occupational tasks effectively, such as air-traffic controllers, pilots, and military personnel.},

@article{navajas_idiosyncratic_2017,
	abstract = {Confidence is the `feeling of knowing' that accompanies decision-making. Bayesian theory proposes that confidence is a function solely of the perceived probability of being correct. Empirical research has suggested, however, that different individuals may perform different computations to estimate confidence from uncertain evidence. To test this hypothesis, we collected confidence reports in a task in which subjects made categorical decisions about the mean of a sequence. We found that for most individuals, confidence did indeed reflect the perceived probability of being correct. However, in approximately half of them, confidence also reflected a different probabilistic quantity: the perceived uncertainty in the estimated variable. We found that the contribution of both quantities was stable over weeks. We also observed that the influence of the perceived probability of being correct was stable across two tasks, one perceptual and one cognitive. Overall, our findings provide a computational interpretation of individual differences in human confidence.},

@article{jans_examining_2023,
	abstract = {Background: Clinical decision making is an essential cognitive skill in nursing. It is a process undertaken daily by nurses as they make judgements about patient care and manage complex issues as they arise. Virtual reality is an emerging technology that is increasingly being used pedagogically to teach non-technical skills including CDM, communication, situational awareness, stress management, leadership, and teamwork.
Objective: The objective of this integrative review are to synthesise the research findings regarding the impact of virtual reality on clinical decision making in undergraduate nurses. Design: An integrative review using Whittemore and Knafl's framework for integrated reviews. Data sources: An extensive search was conducted of healthcare databases including CINAHL, Medline and Web of Science between 2010 and 2021 using the terms virtual reality, clinical decision and undergraduate nursing. Review methods: The initial search located 98 articles. After screening and checking for eligibility, 70 articles were critically reviewed. Eighteen studies were included in the review and were critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative papers and McMaster's Critical appraisal form for quantitative papers.
Results: Research in the use of VR has demonstrated its potential to improve undergraduate nurses' critical thinking, clinical reasoning, clinical judgement and clinical decision-making skills. Students perceive these teaching modalities to be beneficial to the development of their clinical decision-making ability. There is lack of research related to the use of immersive virtual reality in developing and enhancing undergraduate nursing students' clinical decision-making skills.
Conclusion: Current research on the impact of virtual reality on the development of nursing CDM has demon- strated positive results. VR is one pedagogical approach that could further assist, however, there are no identified studies that focus on its impact in developing CDM, therefore further studies are required to address this gap in the literature.},

In this AMEE Guide, we define reflexivity as a set of continuous, collaborative, and multifaceted practices through which researchers self-consciously critique, appraise, and evaluate how their subjectivity and context influence the research processes. We frame reflexivity as a way to embrace and value researchers' subjectivity. We also describe the purposes that reflexivity can have depending on different paradigmatic choices. We then address how researchers can account for the significance of the intertwined personal, interpersonal, methodological, and contextual factors that bring research into being and offer specific strategies for communicating reflexivity in research dissemination. With the growth of qualitative research in health professions education, it is essential that qualitative researchers carefully consider their paradigmatic stance and use reflexive practices to align their decisions at all stages of their research. We hope this Guide will illuminate such a path, demonstrating how reflexivity can be used to develop and communicate rigorous qualitative research.},

          Prospective study with patient and physician questionnaires, clinical records, and imaging.
          Objective. 
          To compare physician expectations of surgery for sciatica and patient outcome.
          Summary of Background Data. 
          Physician accuracy in identifying individual patient prognosis is important for therapeutic decisions.
          Methods. 
          A total of 197 consecutive patients with low back pain and/or sciatica who underwent low back surgery in the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.
          Results. 
          Physicians predicted ``a great improvement'' of quality of life after surgery for 79\% and ``moderate improvement'' for 20\% (1\% others); 39\% of patients had no ``minimal clinically important difference'' in back pain after surgery, despite physician prediction of ``great improvement.'' Correlations between physician expectation and various dimensions of patient outcome were not significant, and agreement with patient global judgment of 1-year outcome was poor (kappa = 0.03). However, in a subgroup where the indication for treatment was not considered appropriate, physician prediction of ``great improvement'' was followed by greater improvement outcome on SF-36 mental component score (P = 0.05), mental health (0.02), and general health (0.03) compared with patients where the physician did not predict ``great improvement.''
          Conclusion. 
          Despite clear average improvement, surgeons tended to give overly optimistic predictions that were not correlated with patient outcome. For patients receiving a treatment not meeting explicit criteria of appropriateness, more optimistic physician expectation was associated with better improvement of psychological dimensions. Besides prognostic ability, the influence of physician expectation on patient outcome is discussed and the concept of ``curabo effect'' (differentiated from ``placebo effect'') proposed.},

This review aimed to describe types of cognitive bias in surgery, their impact on surgical performance and patient outcomes, their source, and the mitigation strategies used to reduce their effect.A literature search was conducted on 9 April and 6 December 2021 using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Included studies investigated how cognitive biases affect surgery and the mitigation strategies used to combat their impact. The National Institutes of Health tools were used to assess study quality. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify themes of cognitive bias impact on surgical performance.Thirty-nine studies were included, comprising 6514 surgeons and over 200 000 patients. Thirty-one types of cognitive bias were identified, with overconfidence, anchoring, and confirmation bias the most common. Cognitive biases differentially influenced six themes of surgical performance. For example, overconfidence bias associated with inaccurate perceptions of ability, whereas anchoring bias associated with inaccurate risk--benefit estimations and not considering alternative options. Anchoring and confirmation biases associated with actual patient harm, such as never events. No studies investigated cognitive bias source or mitigation strategies.Cognitive biases have a negative impact on surgical performance and patient outcomes across all points of surgical care. This review highlights the scarcity of research investigating the sources that give rise to cognitive biases in surgery and the mitigation strategies that target these factors.},

@article{gilhooly_cognitive_1990,
	abstract = {The nature and acquisition of complex cognitive skills have been intensively investigated over the past 20 years. From such studies in non-medical domains it appears that experts (a) generally remember new information in their field better than do the less expert; (b) work forward to solutions; (c) form superior representations of problems; (d) are superior in knowledge, not in basic processing abilities; and (e) require extensive practice over a period of years to achieve expert status. Studies of expertise in medical diagnosis have found two major departures from the typical findings in other areas of expertise, viz. that memory for new information seems best at intermediate levels of skill rather than at high levels, and that a mixture of forward and backward reasoning (hypothetico-deductive inference) is common at all levels of skill in medical diagnosis. These departures from findings in other domains are explained by the special characteristics of both medical knowledge and the diagnostic task.},

@article{peters_perceptual_2017,
	abstract = {Our perceptual experiences are accompanied by a subjective sense of certainty. These confidence judgements typically correlate meaningfully with the probability that the relevant decision is correct1,2,3,4,5,6, bolstering prevailing opinion that both perceptual decisions and confidence optimally reflect the probability of having made a correct decision6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, recent behavioural reports suggest that confidence computations overemphasize information supporting a decision, while selectively down-weighting evidence for other possible choices14,15,16,17,18,19. This view remains controversial, and supporting neurobiological evidence has been lacking. Here we use intracranial electrophysiological recordings in humans together with machine-learning techniques to demonstrate that perceptual decisions and confidence rely on spatiotemporally separable neural representations in a face/house discrimination task. We then use normative computational models to show that confidence relies excessively on evidence supporting a decision (for example, face evidence for a `face' decision), even while decisions themselves reflect the optimal balance of all evidence (for example, both face and house evidence). Thus, confidence may not reflect a readout of the probability of being correct; instead, observers may sacrifice optimality in favour of self-consistency20 in the face of limited neural and computational resources. Although seemingly suboptimal, this strategy may reflect the inference problem that perceptual systems are evolutionarily optimized to solve.},

@article{oeberst_toward_2023,
	abstract = {One of the essential insights from psychological research is that people's information processing is often biased. By now, a number of different biases have been identified and empirically demonstrated. Unfortunately, however, these biases have often been examined in separate lines of research, thereby precluding the recognition of shared principles. Here we argue that several---so far mostly unrelated---biases (e.g., bias blind spot, hostile media bias, egocentric/ethnocentric bias, outcome bias) can be traced back to the combination of a fundamental prior belief and humans' tendency toward belief-consistent information processing. What varies between different biases is essentially the specific belief that guides information processing. More importantly, we propose that different biases even share the same underlying belief and differ only in the specific outcome of information processing that is assessed (i.e., the dependent variable), thus tapping into different manifestations of the same latent information processing. In other words, we propose for discussion a model that suffices to explain several different biases. We thereby suggest a more parsimonious approach compared with current theoretical explanations of these biases. We also generate novel hypotheses that follow directly from the integrative nature of our perspective.},

The current research provides new insight into the conditions that frame the intergroup outcomes of perspective taking. The results show that the effects of perspective taking are not always positive but depend on perspective takers' degree of identification with the in-group. In two experiments, we demonstrated that adopting the perspective of an out-group member can have damaging effects on intergroup perceptions among group members who are highly identified with the in-group. Specifically, compared with less committed members, those who identified highly with the in-group used a greater number of negative traits to describe the out-group following perspective taking. Such perspective taking also led participants with high in-group identification to judge the out-group less favorably. Understanding how social identity concerns frame the outcome of perspective taking is crucial to its effective employment in intergroup-relations programs.},

Often, decisions made this way are correct, but at crucial moments they can also be wrong Ð with catastrophic consequences. In this myth-shattering book, Jerome Groopman pinpoints the forces and thought processes behind the decisions doctors make. Groopman explores why doctors err and shows when and how they can Ð with our help Ð avoid snap judgments, embrace uncertainty, communicate effectively, and deploy other skills that can profoundly impact our health. This book is the first to describe in detail the warning signs of erroneous medical thinking and reveal how new technologies may actually hinder accurate diagnoses. How Doctors Think offers direct, intelligent questions patients can ask their doctors to help them get back on track. Groopman draws on a wealth of research, extensive interviews with some of the country's best doctors, and his own experience as a doctor and as a patient. He has learned many of the lessons in this book the hard way, from his own mistakes and from errors his doctors made in treating his debilitating medical problems. How Doctors Think reveals a profound new view of twenty-first-century medical practice, giving doctors and patients the vital information they need to make better judgments together.},

@article{kammer_potential_2017,
	abstract = {Background. Evidence suggests that pooling multiple independent diagnoses can improve diagnostic accuracy in well-defined tasks. We investigated whether this is also the case for diagnostics in emergency medicine, an ill-defined task environment where diagnostic errors are rife. Methods. A computer simulation study was conducted based on empirical data from 2 published experimental studies. In the computer experiments, 285 medical students independently diagnosed 6 simulated patients arriving at the emergency room with dyspnea. Participants' diagnoses (n = 1,710), confidence ratings, and expertise levels were entered into a computer simulation. Virtual groups of different sizes were randomly created, and 3 collective intelligence rules (follow-the-plurality rule, follow-the-most-confident rule, and follow-the-most-senior rule) were applied to combine the independent decisions into a final diagnosis. For different group sizes, the performance levels (i.e., percentage of correct diagnoses) of the 3 collective intelligence rules were compared with each other and against the average individual accuracy. Results. For all collective intelligence rules, combining independent decisions substantially increased performance relative to average individual performance. For groups of 4 or fewer, the follow-the-most-confident rule outperformed the other rules; for larger groups, the follow-the-plurality rule performed best. For example, combining 5 independent decisions using the follow-the-plurality rule increased diagnostic accuracy by 22 percentage points. These results were robust across case difficulty and expertise level. Limitations of the study include the use of simulated patients diagnosed by medical students. Whether results generalize to clinical practice is currently unknown. Conclusion. Combining independent decisions may substantially improve the quality of diagnoses in emergency medicine and may thus enhance patient safety.},

@article{joseph_domain_1990,
	abstract = {The role of domain knowledge in the process of hypothesis generation during diagnostic reasoning was examined. Subjects were given a clinical case presented one segment at a time on a microcomputer. They were prompted to think aloud after presentation of each segment of the clinical case. A combination of discourse and protocol analysis techniques was used to investigate the problem solving process in two groups of experts working on an endocrine problem. The groups consisted of high-domain-knowledge subjects (HDK), endocrinologists, and low-domain-knowledge subjects (LDK), cardiologists. The results showed no significant differences between the groups in terms of selection of relevant and critical cues from the case. However, specific differences were found in the links or relations between the cues, with the HDK subjects using more relations to connect important information. The HDK subjects generated accurate diagnostic hypotheses early in the problem encounter and spent the rest of the time confirming the hypotheses by explaining the given cues. The LDK subjects also generated accurate diagnostic hypotheses but were unable to discriminate between and eliminate alternative hypotheses. A two-stage problem solving process and its relationship to domain specific knowledge are proposed.

Hence, there may be a place for diagnostic aids (such as the Surgical Sieve) that provide a framework for generating ideas about diagnoses. With repeated use of the Surgical Sieve in teaching sessions with students, and prompted by the traditional handheld wheels used in antenatal clinics, we developed the Compass Medicine, a handheld diagnostic wheel comprising three concentric discs attached at the centre. We report a preliminary study comparing the Surgical Sieve and the Compass Medicine in generating differential diagnoses. Methods A total of 48 third-year medical students from Cardiff University participated in a study aimed at measuring the efficacy of diagnostic aids (Surgical Sieve and Compass Medicine) in generating diagnoses. We quantified the effect each aid had on the number of diagnoses generated, and compared the size of the effect between the two diagnostic aids. There may be a place for diagnostic aids that provide a framework for generating ideas about diagnoses Results The study suggests that both diagnostic aids prompted users to generate a greater number of diagnoses, but there was no significant difference in the size of effect between the two diagnostic aids. Discussion We hope that our study with diagnostic aids will encourage the use of robust tools to teach medical students an easily visualised framework for diagnostic thinking.},

	abstract = {Objectives Cognitive and other biases can influence the quality of healthcare decision making. While substantial research has explored how biases can lead to diagnostic or other errors in medicine, fewer studies have examined how they impact the decision making of other healthcare professionals. This scoping review aimed to identify and synthesise a broad range of research investigating whether decisions made by allied health professionals are influenced by cognitive, affective or other biases. Materials and methods A systematic literature search was conducted in five electronic databases. Title, abstract and full text screening was undertaken in duplicate, using prespecified eligibility criteria designed to identify studies attempting to demonstrate the presence of bias when allied healthcare professionals make decisions. A narrative synthesis was undertaken, focussing on the type of allied health profession, type of decision, and type of bias reported within the included studies. Results The search strategy identified 149 studies. Of these, 119 studies came from the field of psychology, with substantially fewer from social work, physical and occupational therapy, speech pathology, audiology and genetic counselling. Diagnostic and assessment decisions were the most common decision types, with fewer studies assessing treatment, prognostic or other clinical decisions. Studies investigated the presence of over 30 cognitive, affective and other decision making biases, including stereotyping biases, anchoring, and confirmation bias. Overall, 77\% of the studies reported at least one outcome that represented the presence of a bias. Conclusion This scoping review provides an overview of studies investigating whether decisions made by allied health professionals are influenced by cognitive, affective or other biases. Biases have the potential to seriously impact the quality, consistency and accuracy of decision making in allied health practice. The findings highlight a need for further research particularly in professional disciplines outside of psychology, using methods that reflect real life healthcare decision making.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic errors contribute to as many as 70\% of medical errors. Prevention of diagnostic errors is more complex than building safety checks into health care systems; it requires an understanding of critical thinking, of clinical reasoning, and of the cognitive processes through which diagnoses are made. When a diagnostic error is recognized, it is imperative to identify where and how the mistake in clinical reasoning occurred. Cognitive biases may contribute to errors in clinical reasoning. By understanding how physicians make clinical decisions, and examining how errors due to cognitive biases occur, cognitive bias awareness training and debiasing strategies may be developed to decrease diagnostic errors and patient harm. Studies of the impact of teaching critical thinking skills have mixed results but are limited by methodological problems.
          This Perspective explores the role of clinical reasoning and cognitive bias in diagnostic error, as well as the effect of instruction in metacognitive skills on improvement of diagnostic accuracy for both learners and practitioners. Recent literature questioning whether teaching critical thinking skills increases diagnostic accuracy is critically examined, as are studies suggesting that metacognitive practices result in better patient care and outcomes. Instruction in metacognition, reflective practice, and cognitive bias awareness may help learners move toward adaptive expertise and help clinicians improve diagnostic accuracy. The authors argue that explicit instruction in metacognition in medical education, including awareness of cognitive biases, has the potential to reduce diagnostic errors and thus improve patient safety.},

@article{han_varieties_2011,
	abstract = {Uncertainty is a pervasive and important problem that has attracted increasing attention in health care, given the growing emphasis on evidence-based medicine, shared decision making, and patient-centered care. However, our understanding of this problem is limited, in part because of the absence of a unified, coherent concept of uncertainty. There are multiple meanings and varieties of uncertainty in health care that are not often distinguished or acknowledged although each may have unique effects or warrant different courses of action. The literature on uncertainty in health care is thus fragmented, and existing insights have been incompletely translated to clinical practice. This article addresses this problem by synthesizing diverse theoretical and empirical literature from the fields of communication, decision science, engineering, health services research, and psychology and developing a new integrative conceptual taxonomy of uncertainty. A 3-dimensional taxonomy is proposed that characterizes uncertainty in health care according to its fundamental sources, issues, and locus. It is shown how this new taxonomy facilitates an organized approach to the problem of uncertainty in health care by clarifying its nature and prognosis and suggesting appropriate strategies for its analysis and management.},

@article{stephens_exploring_2021,
	abstract = {Tolerance of uncertainty, a construct describing individuals' responses to perceived uncertainty, has relevancy across healthcare systems, yet little work explores the impact of education on medical students' tolerance of uncertainty. While debate remains as to whether tolerance of uncertainty is changeable or static, the prevailing conceptual healthcare tolerance of uncertainty model (Hillen et al. in Soc Sci Med 180:62--75, 2017) suggests that individuals' tolerance of uncertainty is influenced by so-called moderators. Evidence regarding education's role as a moderator of tolerance of uncertainty is, however, lacking. Preliminary work exploring medical students' professional identity formation within anatomy learning identified tolerance of uncertainty as a theme warranting further exploration. Extending from this work, our research question was: How does the anatomy education learning environment impact medical students' tolerance of uncertainty? To address this question, qualitative data were collected longitudinally across two successive cohorts through online discussion forums during semester and end of semester interviews. Framework analysis identified five stimuli of uncertainty, four moderators of uncertainty, and cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to uncertainty with variable valency (positive and/or negative). Longitudinal data analyses indicated changes in stimuli, moderators and responses to uncertainty over time, suggesting that tolerance of uncertainty is changeable rather than static. While our findings support the Hillen et al. (Soc Sci Med 180:62--75, 2017) model in parts, our data extend this model and the previous literature. Although further research is needed about students' development of tolerance of uncertainty in the clinical learning environment, we encourage medical educators to incorporate aspects of tolerance of uncertainty into curricular and learning environments.},

	abstract = {Rationale, aims, and objectives Uncertainty is a complex and constant phenomenon in clinical practice. How medical students recognize and respond to uncertainty impacts on their well-being, career choices, and attitudes towards patients. It has been suggested that curricula should do more to prepare medical students for an uncertain world. In order to teach medical students about uncertainty, we need to understand how uncertainty has been conceptualized in the literature to date. The aim of this article is to explore existing models of uncertainty and to develop a framework of clinical uncertainty to aid medical education. Method A scoping literature review was performed to identify conceptual models of uncertainty in healthcare. Content and inductive analyses were performed to explore three dimensions of clinical uncertainty: sources of uncertainty, subjective influencers and responses to uncertainty. Results Nine hundred one references were identified using our search strategy, of which, 24 met our inclusion criteria. It was possible to classify these conceptual models using one or more of three dimensions of uncertainty; sources, subjective influencers, and responses. Exploration and further classification of these dimensions led to the development of a framework of uncertainty for medical education. Conclusion The developed framework of clinical uncertainty highlights sources, subjective influencers, responses to uncertainty, and the dynamic relationship among these elements. Our framework illustrates the different aspects of knowledge as a source of uncertainty and how to distinguish between those aspects. Our framework highlights the complexity of sources of uncertainty, especially when including uncertainty arising from relationships and systems. These sources can occur in combination. Our framework is also novel in how it describes the impact of influencers such as personal characteristics, experience, and affect on perceptions of and responses to uncertainty. This framework can be used by educators and curricula developers to help understand and teach about clinical uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Two experiments examined the role of alternative hypotheses in the recognition of belief-incongruent evidence and the consequent attribution of probative value to that evidence. Using a contingency judgement and prediction task, subjects monitored multiple predictor-outcome contingencies. In a subset of three of these contingencies the evidence strongly endorsed a positive contingency in a first phase but strongly endorsed a negative contingency in a second phase. In Experiment 1 the negative evidence was presented, in part, in terms of an alternative contingency involving a new predictor or a new outcome, or in terms of no alternatives. The presence of alternative hypotheses did not influence the recognition of the negative evidence but significantly reduced the subjects' persistence in predicting the outcome in the presence of the predictor. Using the same positive-negative contingencies, Experiment 2 replicated this effect but also demonstrated that error in the feedback during the negative phase strengthened the perseverance in outcome predictions even when subjects acknowledged the negative nature of the evidence. Results from these two experiments indicate that prior beliefs do not bias the recognition of belief-incongruent evidence but the integration of that evidence is determined by the nature of the alternative hypotheses available to the reasoner.},

@article{croskerry_deciding_2014,
	abstract = {Two reports in this issue address the important topic of clinical decision making. Dual process theory has emerged as the dominant model for understanding the complex processes that underlie human decision making. This theory distinguishes between the reflexive, autonomous processes that characterize intuitive decision making and the deliberate reasoning of an analytical approach. In this commentary, the authors address the polarization of viewpoints that has developed around the relative merits of the two systems. Although intuitive processes are typically fast and analytical processes slow, speed alone does not distinguish them. In any event, the majority of decisions in clinical medicine are not dependent on very short response times. What does appear relevant to diagnostic ease and accuracy is the degree to which the symptoms of the disease being diagnosed are characteristic ones.
          There are also concerns around some methodological issues related to research design in this area of enquiry. Reductionist approaches that attempt to isolate dependent variables may create such artificial experimental conditions that both external and ecological validity are sacrificed. Clinical decision making is a complex process with many independent (and interdependent) variables that need to be separated out in a discrete fashion and then reflected on in real time to preserve the fidelity of clinical practice. With these caveats in mind, the authors believe that research in this area should promote a better understanding of clinical practice and teaching by focusing less on the deficiencies of intuitive and analytical systems and more on their adaptive strengths.},

Among the multiple factors that impact clinical performance of the individual, the caliber of cognition is perhaps the most relevant and deserves our attention and understanding. In the last few decades, cognitive psychologists have gained substantial insights into the processes that underlie cognition, and a new, universal model of reasoning and decision making has emerged, Dual Process Theory. The theory has immediate application to medical decision making and provides an overall schema for understanding the variety of theoretical approaches that have been taken in the past. The model has important practical applications for decision making across the multiple domains of healthcare, and may be used as a template for teaching decision theory, as well as a platform for future research.

@article{hancock_tolerance_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Context The prevalence of stress, burnout and mental health disorders in medical students and doctors is high. It has been proposed that there may be an association between levels of tolerance of ambiguity (ie an ability to tolerate a lack of reliable, credible or adequate information) in clinical work and psychological well-being within this population. The aims of this systematic review were: (i) to assess the nature and extent of the literature available, in order to determine if there is an association, and (ii) to develop a conceptual model proposing possible mechanisms to underpin any association, in order to inform subsequent research. Methods MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published from inception to September 2018. Additional literature was identified by searching the reference lists of included articles, forward searches of included articles, hand searches of key journals and a grey literature search. Of the 671 studies identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. A qualitative synthesis of included studies was performed. Results All 11 included studies reported an association between a lower level of tolerance of ambiguity or uncertainty and reduced psychological well-being. Included studies were heterogeneous in terms of population and measurement approach, and were often of low methodological quality. Subsets of items from previously developed scales were often used without sufficient consideration of the impact of new combinations of items on scale validity. Similar scales were also scored inconsistently between studies, making comparison difficult. Conclusions There appears to be an association between tolerance of ambiguity and psychological well-being. This provides new opportunities to understand and prevent the development of stress, burnout and mental health disorders in medical students and doctors. The conceptual model developed provides a framework for future research, which we hope will prevent wasted research effort through duplication and promote higher methodological quality.},

The analysis shows that doctors rely on three collaborative practices: (a) joint interpretation, (b) intersubjective generation and validation of hypotheses, and (c) postponing the diagnostic decision. Through such practices, doctors jointly handle tough issues such as managing complexity, dealing with cognitive difficulties and limits of knowledge, and avoiding diagnostic errors. The article addresses some lacunae in the literature by providing empirical access to how decision making is done in an understudied and specialized branch of medicine.},

Exp II simplified the manipulation by asking Ss first to choose an answer and then to list (a) 1 reason supporting that choice, (b) 1 reason contradicting it, or (c) 1 reason supporting and 1 reason contradicting. Only the listing of contradicting reasons improved the appropriateness of confidence. Correlational analyses of the data of Exp I strongly suggested that the confidence depends on the amount and strength of the evidence supporting the answer chosen.

@article{rouault_forming_2019,
	abstract = {Metacognition, the ability to internally evaluate our own cognitive performance, is particularly useful since many real-life decisions lack immediate feedback. While most previous studies have focused on the construction of confidence at the level of single decisions, little is known about the formation of ``global'' self-performance estimates (SPEs) aggregated from multiple decisions. Here, we compare the formation of SPEs in the presence and absence of feedback, testing a hypothesis that local decision confidence supports the formation of SPEs when feedback is unavailable. We reveal that humans pervasively underestimate their performance in the absence of feedback, compared to a condition with full feedback, despite objective performance being unaffected. We find that fluctuations in confidence contribute to global SPEs over and above objective accuracy and reaction times. Our findings create a bridge between a computation of local confidence and global SPEs, and support a functional role for confidence in higher-order behavioral control.},

The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

@article{nendaz_diagnostic_2012,
	abstract = {Diagnostic errors account for more than 8\% of adverse events in medicine and up to 30\% of malpractice claims. Mechanisms of errors may be related to the working environment but cognitive issues are involved in about 75\% of the cases, either alone or in association with system failures. The majority of cognitive errors are not related to knowledge deficiency but to flaws in data collection, data integration, and data verification that may lead to premature diagnostic closure. This paper reviews some aspects of the literature on cognitive psychology that help us to understand reasoning processes and knowledge organisation and summarises biases related to clinical reasoning. It reviews the strategies described to prevent cognitive diagnostic errors. Many approaches propose awareness and reflective practice during daily activities, but the improvement of the quality of training at the pre-graduate, postgraduate and continuous levels, by using evidence-based education, should also be considered. Several conditions must be fulfilled to increase the understanding, the prevention, and the correction of diagnostic errors related to clinical reasoning: physicians must be willing to understand their own reasoning and decision processes; training efforts should be provided during the whole continuum of a clinician's career; and the involvement of medical schools, teaching hospitals, and medical societies in medical education research should be increased to improve evidence about error prevention.},

@article{thammasitboon_diagnostic_2013,
	abstract = {A significant portion of diagnostic errors arises through cognitive errors resulting from inadequate knowledge, faulty data gathering, and/or faulty verification. Experts estimate that 75\% of diagnostic failures can be attributed to clinician diagnostic thinking failure. The cognitive processes that underlie diagnostic thinking of clinicians are complex and intriguing, and it is imperative that clinicians acquire explicit appreciation and application of different cognitive approaches to make decisions better. A dual-process model that unifies many theories of decision-making has emerged as a promising template for understanding how clinicians think and judge efficiently in a diagnostic reasoning process. The identification and implementation of strategies for decreasing or preventing such diagnostic errors has become a growing area of interest and research. Suggested strategies to decrease diagnostic error incidence include increasing clinician's clinical expertise and avoiding inherent cognitive errors to make decisions better. Implementing Interventions focused solely on avoiding errors may work effectively for patient safety issues such as medication errors. Addressing cognitive errors, however, requires equal effort on expanding the individual clinician's expertise. Providing cognitive support to clinicians for robust diagnostic decision-making serves as the final strategic target for decreasing diagnostic errors. Clinical guidelines and algorithms offer another method for streamlining decision-making and decreasing likelihood of cognitive diagnostic errors. Addressing cognitive processing errors is undeniably the most challenging task in reducing diagnostic errors. While many suggested approaches exist, they are mostly based on theories and sciences in cognitive psychology, decision-making, and education. The proposed interventions are primarily suggestions and very few of them have been tested in the actual practice settings. Collaborative research effort is required to effectively address cognitive processing errors. Researchers in various areas, including patient safety/quality improvement, decision-making, and problem solving, must work together to make medical diagnosis more reliable.},

In particular, it is suggested that people tend to test those cases that have the best chance of verifying current beliefs rather than those that have the best chance of falsifying them. We show, however, that many phenomena labeled "confirmation bias" are better understood in terms of a general positive test strategy. With this strategy, there is a tendency to test cases that are expected (or known) to have the property of interest rather than those expected (or known) to lack that property. We show that the positive test strategy can be a very good heuristic for determining the truth or falsity of a hypothesis under realistic conditions. It can, however, lead to systematic errors or inefficiencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{ely_checklists_2011,
	abstract = {Diagnostic errors are common and can often be traced to physicians' cognitive biases and failed heuristics (mental shortcuts). A great deal is known about how these faulty thinking processes lead to error, but little is known about how to prevent them. Faulty thinking plagues other high-risk, high-reliability professions, such as airline pilots and nuclear plant operators, but these professions have reduced errors by using checklists. Recently, checklists have gained acceptance in medical settings, such as operating rooms and intensive care units. This article extends the checklist concept to diagnosis and describes three types of checklists: (1) a general checklist that prompts physicians to optimize their cognitive approach, (2) a differential diagnosis checklist to help physicians avoid the most common cause of diagnostic error---failure to consider the correct diagnosis as a possibility, and (3) a checklist of common pitfalls and cognitive forcing functions to improve evaluation of selected diseases. These checklists were developed informally and have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. The purpose of this article is to argue for the further investigation and revision of these initial attempts to apply checklists to the diagnostic process. The basic idea behind checklists is to provide an alternative to reliance on intuition and memory in clinical problem solving. This kind of solution is demanded by the complexity of diagnostic reasoning, which often involves sense-making under conditions of great uncertainty and limited time.},

@article{muller_impact_2018,
	abstract = {Objectives Communication breakdown is one of the main causes of adverse events in clinical routine, particularly in handover situations. The communication tool SBAR (situation, background, assessment and recommendation) was developed to increase handover quality and is widely assumed to increase patient safety. The objective of this review is to summarise the impact of the implementation of SBAR on patient safety.
Design A systematic review of articles published on SBAR was performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO in January 2017. All original research articles on SBAR fulfilling the following eligibility criteria were included: (1) SBAR was implemented into clinical routine, (2) the investigation of SBAR was the primary objective and (3) at least one patient outcome was reported.
Setting A wide range of settings within primary and secondary care and nursing homes.
Participants A variety of heath professionals including nurses and physicians.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Aspects of patient safety (patient outcomes) defined as the occurrence or incidence of adverse events.
Results Eight studies with a before--after design and three controlled clinical trials performed in different clinical settings met the inclusion criteria. The objectives of the studies were to improve team communication, patient hand-offs and communication in telephone calls from nurses to physicians. The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study characteristics, especially patient outcomes. In total, 26 different patient outcomes were measured, of which eight were reported to be significantly improved. Eleven were described as improved but no further statistical tests were reported, and six outcomes did not change significantly. Only one study reported a descriptive reduction in patient outcomes.
Conclusions This review found moderate evidence for improved patient safety through SBAR implementation, especially when used to structure communication over the phone. However, there is a lack of high-quality research on this widely used communication tool.

@article{sibbald_eyeballing_2017,
	abstract = {Context Prior studies suggest that clinicians can categorise patients in an emergency room as `sick' or `not sick' using rapid visual assessment. The rapid nature of these decisions suggests clinicians are relying on pattern recognition or System 1 processing; however, this has not been studied experimentally. In this study, we explore the accuracy of these decisions using patient disposition (discharge, admission to ward or admission to critical care) as an objective outcome, and collect evidence to argue for the use of System 1 processing in the `sick' or `not sick' decision process. Methods Fourteen practising emergency physicians reviewed 25 videos of patients presenting to the emergency room. They were asked to predict patient disposition (discharge, admission to ward or admission to critical care) and estimate whether they were `sick' or `not sick' using a continuous slider on a `sick' scale from `not sick' (0) to `sick' (100). We collected decision time and asked physicians to identify how they came to the decision using a continuous slider on a `system processing' scale from `knew immediately' (0) to `deliberated intently' (1). Results Inter-rater reliability judging `sick' was computed as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.54. Agreement among physicians in predicting disposition was 68\% with ICC of 0.44, and accuracy at predicting disposition was 55\%. Physicians made their decision in an average of 10 -- 11 seconds and rated 70\% of their decisions as {\textless} 0.5 on the scale from `knew immediately' (0) to `deliberated intently' (1). Conclusions Experienced emergency physicians are able to visually assess patients rapidly and predict disposition in a very short time, albeit with fair reliability and lower accuracy than reported previously. Subjectively, they reported that the majority of decisions were on the side of `knew immediately', consistent with the application of System 1 processing.},

@article{aron_diagnostic_2024,
	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Diagnostic momentum refers to ruling in a particular diagnosis without adequate evidence. As the field of physical therapy continues to transition more towards autonomous practitioners with direct access, there is a need to identify the effect of a physician diagnosis on a therapist's examination and treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify if diagnostic momentum exists in physical therapy and whether this phenomenon could affect the ability of the therapist to identify clinical red flags. Methods An online survey with randomized case scenarios was completed by 75 licensed practicing physical therapists. Participants received one of two scenarios: a case vignette where the patient was referred to physical therapy for left shoulder pain and presented with `red flags' indicative of myocardial infarction, or a similar vignette with additional results from an exercise stress test that ruled out myocardial infarction. The subjects were asked if they would `treat' or `refer' to another healthcare provider and the reason behind their decision. Independent t-tests and χ2 analyses were conducted to understand the differences between the groups. A thematic analysis was used to explore the therapists' responses regarding the reasoning for their decision. Results There was no significant difference in clinical decision making based on age, gender, years of experience, advanced certification, primary caseload or primary practice setting. Among those who received the case without the stress test, 31.4\% of participants indicated that they would refer, compared to 12.5\% of the participants that had the additional stress test result included within their case. The presence of the negative stress test was indicated as the main reason for choosing to treat without referral by 65.7\% of the subjects that received the additional stress test result. Conclusion This study suggests that practicing physical therapists may be influenced by diagnostic decisions made by other clinicians, causing them to overlook signs and symptoms of possible myocardial infarction.},

	abstract = {Research on selective exposure to information consistently shows that after having made a decision, people prefer supporting over conflicting information. However, in all of these experiments participants were given an overview of all available pieces of information, selected them simultaneously, and did not process the requested information during the selection phase. In the present research the authors show that an even stronger preference for supporting information arises if information is presented and processed sequentially instead of simultaneously (Experiment 1), and they demonstrate that this stronger confirmation bias is due to sequential presentation and not to sequential processing of information (Experiment 2). The authors provide evidence that the increase in confirmation bias under sequential presentation is caused by heightened commitment due to the participants' increased focusing on their decision (Experiments 3 and 4).

@article{scherer_trust_2015,
	abstract = {Objective: Decision aids (DAs) play an increasingly critical role in supporting patients in making preference-sensitive treatment decisions. One largely untested assumption of DA design is that patients should be encouraged to deliberate carefully about their options after being informed of those options. The purpose of the present research is to test the impact of deliberative versus intuitive decision strategies in medical decision contexts. Method: In 3 experiments, participants were randomly assigned to make a hypothetical medical decision either intuitively, or using various deliberative strategies. In Study 1, we predicted that deliberation would improve decision confidence while not changing decisions. In Study 2, our aim was to establish whether the observed increase in confidence was due to decision-making effort, confirmation bias, or both. In Study 3, it was predicted that deliberation would cause participants to become more confident in suboptimal decisions. Results: Across 3 studies, participants who deliberated felt better about their decisions and decision process, even when the decision was the same as what would have been chosen intuitively (Studies 1 and 2), and even when the decision was normatively bad (Study 3). Study 2 additionally indicated that participants' confidence was driven by confirmation bias rather than effort justification. Conclusions: Deliberative tasks may often fail to be an effective debiasing tool, and components of patient decision aids that ask patients to deliberate may serve to improve how patients feel without improving the quality of their decisions.

@article{balsdon_confidence_2020,
	abstract = {Perceptual decisions are accompanied by feelings of confidence that reflect the likelihood that the decision was correct. Here we aim to clarify the relationship between perception and confidence by studying the same perceptual task across three different confidence contexts. Human observers were asked to categorize the source of sequentially presented visual stimuli. Each additional stimulus provided evidence for making more accurate perceptual decisions, and better confidence judgements. We show that observers' ability to set appropriate evidence accumulation bounds for perceptual decisions is strongly predictive of their ability to make accurate confidence judgements. When observers were not permitted to control their exposure to evidence, they imposed covert bounds on their perceptual decisions but not on their confidence decisions. This partial dissociation between decision processes is reflected in behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings suggest a confidence-regulated accumulation-to-bound process that controls perceptual decision-making even in the absence of explicit speed-accuracy trade-offs.},

@article{lambe_dual-process_2016,
	abstract = {Background Diagnostic error incurs enormous human and economic costs. The dual-process model reasoning provides a framework for understanding the diagnostic process and attributes certain errors to faulty cognitive shortcuts (heuristics). The literature contains many suggestions to counteract these and to enhance analytical and non-analytical modes of reasoning.
Aims To identify, describe and appraise studies that have empirically investigated interventions to enhance analytical and non-analytical reasoning among medical trainees and doctors, and to assess their effectiveness.
Methods Systematic searches of five databases were carried out (Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Education Resource Information Centre (ERIC) and Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials), supplemented with searches of bibliographies and relevant journals. Included studies evaluated an intervention to enhance analytical and/or non-analytical reasoning among medical trainees or doctors.
Findings Twenty-eight studies were included under five categories: educational interventions, checklists, cognitive forcing strategies, guided reflection, instructions at test and other interventions. While many of the studies found some effect of interventions, guided reflection interventions emerged as the most consistently successful across five studies, and cognitive forcing strategies improved accuracy and confidence judgements. Significant heterogeneity of measurement approaches was observed, and existing studies are largely limited to early-career doctors.
Conclusions Results to date are promising and this relatively young field is now close to a point where these kinds of cognitive interventions can be recommended to educators. Further research with refined methodology and more diverse samples is required before firm recommendations may be made for medical education and policy; however, these results suggest that such interventions hold promise, with much current enthusiasm for new research.},

Decisions concerned either medical matters or monetary gambles. Subjects rated the quality of thinking of the decisions, the competence of the decision maker, or their willingness to let the decision maker decide on their behalf. Subjects understood that they had all relevant information available to the decision maker. Subjects rated the thinking as better, rated the decision maker as more competent, or indicated greater willingness to yield the decision when the outcome was favorable than when it was unfavorable. In monetary gambles, subjects rated the thinking as better when the outcome of the option not chosen turned out poorly than when it turned out well. Although subjects who were asked felt that they should not consider outcomes in making these evaluations, they did so.

This paper reports the results of a meta-analytic review of research examining self-serving attributions in the context of sports events. A total of 91 distinct hypothesis tests were located, comprising five dimensions of attribution: ability (N= 21), effort (N= 21), task difficulty (N= 21), luck (N= 21), and a general internal-external dimension (N= 7). The meta-analytic combination of significance levels indicated that the combined results were unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis of no effect were true (for each of the five dimensions of attribution). The internal-external dimension and the ability dimension produced effects of moderate magnitude, whereas effort, difficulty and luck produced effects of small magnitude. Meta-anaiytic focused comparisons revealed that self-serving attributions (ended to be more extreme in the context of larger team sizes, and for attribution measures focused upon the team rather than the individual. Discussion considers the implications of these findings and develops and explanation for the finding that ability is the specific attribution dimension exhibiting the greatest self-serving attribution effects.},

These bring both opportunity and uncertainty. 21st Century Challenges Persistent challenges such as the opioid epidemic, rising health care costs, misaligned incentives, patients with multiple chronic diseases, and emergency department crowding continue to plague the acute, unscheduled care system. Reductionism and Complex Systems Thinking The traditional approach to health care practice and improvement--reductionism--is not adequate for the complexity of the twenty-first century. Reductionist thinking will likely continue to produce unintended consequences and suboptimal outcomes. Complex systems thinking provides a perspective and set of tools better suited for the challenges and opportunities facing public health in general, and emergency medicine more specifically. Implications for Emergency Medicine This article introduces complex systems thinking and argues for its application in the context of emergency medicine by drawing on the history of the circumstances surrounding the formation of the specialty and by providing examples of its application to several practice challenges.},

	abstract = {Background  The ability to capture the complexities of healthcare practices and the quick turnaround of findings make rapid ethnographies appealing to the healthcare sector, where changing organisational climates and priorities require actionable findings at strategic time points. Despite methodological advancement, there continue to be challenges in the implementation of rapid ethnographies concerning sampling, the interpretation of findings and management of field research. The purpose of this review was to explore the benefits and challenges of using rapid ethnographies to inform healthcare organisation and delivery and identify areas that require improvement.
Methods  This was a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the articles. We developed the search strategy using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Settingframework and searched for peer-reviewed articles in MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, Web of Science and ProQuest Central. We included articles that reported findings from rapid ethnographies in healthcare contexts or addressing issues related to health service use.
Results  26 articles were included in the review. We found an increase in the use of rapid ethnographies in the last 2‰years. We found variability in terminology and developed a typology to clarify conceptual differences. The studies generated findings that could be used to inform policy and practice. The main limitations of the studies were: the poor quality of reporting of study designs, mainly data analysis methods, and lack of reflexivity.
Conclusions  Rapid ethnographies have the potential to generate findings that can inform changes in healthcare practices in a timely manner, but greater attention needs to be paid to the reflexive interpretation of findings and the description of research methods.

Study 1 provides evidence from three surveys that people rate themselves as less subject to various biases than the ``average American,'' classmates in a seminar, and fellow airport travelers. Data from the third survey further suggest that such claims arise from the interplay among availability biases and self-enhancement motives. Participants in one follow-up study who showed the better-than-average bias insisted that their self-assessments were accurate and objective even after reading a description of how they could have been affected by the relevant bias. Participants in a final study reported their peer's self-serving attributions regarding test performance to be biased but their own similarly self-serving attributions to be free of bias. The relevance of these phenomena to na{\"\i}ve realism and to conflict, misunderstanding, and dispute resolution is discussed.},

Past literature in information science and organizational studies has employed the cost-benefit framework to analyze Seekers' information-source choice decision. Conflicting findings have been discovered with regard to the importance of source quality and source accessibility in Seekers' choices. With a focus on interpersonal task information seeking, this study proposes a seeker-source-information need framework to understand the source choice decision. In this framework, task importance, as an attribute of information need, is introduced to moderate Seekers' cost-benefit calculation. Our empirical study finds that in the context of interpersonal task information seeking, first, the least effort principle might not be adequate in explaining personal source choices; rather, a quality-driven perspective is more adequate, and cost factors are of much less importance. Second, the seeker-source relationship is not significant to source choices. Third, the nature of information need, especially task importance, can modify Seekers' source choice decisions.},

@article{gehlbach_illusion_2024,
	abstract = {How individuals navigate perspectives and attitudes that diverge from their own affects an array of interpersonal outcomes from the health of marriages to the unfolding of international conflicts. The finesse with which people negotiate these differing perceptions depends critically upon their tacit assumptions---e.g., in the bias of na{\"\i}ve realism people assume that their subjective construal of a situation represents objective truth. The present study adds an important assumption to this list of biases: the illusion of information adequacy. Specifically, because individuals rarely pause to consider what information they may be missing, they assume that the cross-section of relevant information to which they are privy is sufficient to adequately understand the situation. Participants in our preregistered study (N = 1261) responded to a hypothetical scenario in which control participants received full information and treatment participants received approximately half of that same information. We found that treatment participants assumed that they possessed comparably adequate information and presumed that they were just as competent to make thoughtful decisions based on that information. Participants' decisions were heavily influenced by which cross-section of information they received. Finally, participants believed that most other people would make a similar decision to the one they made. We discuss the implications in the context of na{\"\i}ve realism and other biases that implicate how people navigate differences of perspective.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that people prefer supporting to conflicting information when making decisions. Whether this biased information search also occurs in group decision making was examined in three experiments. Experiment 1 indicated that groups as well as individuals prefer supporting information and that the strength of this bias depends on the distribution of the group members' initial decision preferences. The more group members had chosen the same alternative prior to the group discussion (group homogeneity), the more strongly the group preferred information supporting that alternative. Experiment 2 replicated these results with managers. Experiment 3 showed that the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous groups reflect group-level processes. Higher commitment and confidence in homogeneous groups mediated this effect. Functional and dysfunctional aspects of biased information seeking in group decision making are discussed.

	abstract = {Knowing the difference between health service evaluation, audit and research can be tricky especially for the novice researcher. Put simply, nursing research involves finding the answers to questions about ``what nurses should do to help patients,'' audit examines ``whether nurses are doing this , and if not, why not,''1 and service evaluation asks about ``the effect of nursing care on patient experiences and outcomes .'' In this paper, we aim to provide some tips to help guide you through the decision-making process as you begin to plan your evaluation, audit or research project. As a starting point box 1 provides key definitions for each type of project.

\#\#\# Box 1 Definitions of service evaluation, audit and research

▸  What is service evaluation? 

Service evaluation seeks to assess how well a service is achieving its intended aims. It is undertaken to benefit the people using a particular healthcare service and is designed and conducted with the sole purpose of defining or judging the current service.2

The results of service evaluations are mostly used to generate information that can be used to inform local decision-making.

@article{page_strategies_2024,
	abstract = {Background Healthcare systems are operating under substantial pressures. Clinicians and managers are constantly having to make adaptations, which are typically improvised, highly variable and not coordinated across teams. This study aimed to identify and describe the types of everyday pressures in intensive care and the adaptive strategies staff use to respond, with the longer-term aim of developing practical and coordinated strategies for managing under pressure.
Methods We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 20 senior multidisciplinary healthcare professionals from intensive care units (ICUs) in 4 major hospitals in the UK. The interviews explored the everyday pressures faced by intensive care staff and the strategies they use to adapt. A thematic template analysis approach was used to analyse the data based on our previously empirically developed taxonomy of pressures and strategies.
Results The principal source of pressure described was a shortage of staff with the necessary skills and experience to care for the increased numbers and complexity of patients which, in turn, increased staff workload and reduced patient flow. Strategies were categorised into anticipatory (in advance of anticipated pressures) and on the day. The dynamic and unpredictable demands on ICUs meant that strategies were mostly deployed on the day, most commonly by flexing staff, prioritisation of patients and tasks and increasing modes of communication and support.
Conclusions ICU staff use a wide variety of adaptive strategies at times of pressure to minimise risk and maintain a reasonable standard of care for patients. These findings provide the foundation for a portfolio of strategies, which can be flexibly employed when under pressure. There is considerable potential for training clinical leaders and teams in the effective use of adaptive strategies.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

Factor analysis was used to develop scales to measure the aspects of groupthink proposed by Janis (1982). Results supported some, but not all, of the symptoms and defects postulated by Janis. Next, a path analytic procedure was utilized to test the implied causal ordering of the Groupthink model (Janis, 1982, p. 244). This study provides limited support for the causal sequence specified in the model. However, the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests.

	abstract = {A load theory of attention in which distractor rejection depends on the level and type of load involved in current processing was tested. A series of experiments demonstrates that whereas high perceptual load reduces distractor interference, working memory load or dual-task coordination load increases distractor interference. These findings suggest 2 selective attention mechanisms: a perceptual selection mechanism serving to reduce distractor perception in situations of high perceptual load that exhaust perceptual capacity in processing relevant stimuli and a cognitive control mechanism that reduces interference from perceived distractors as long as cognitive control functions are available to maintain current priorities (low cognitive load). This theory resolves the long-standing early versus late selection debate and clarifies the role of cognitive control in selective attention.

@article{murthy_intensive_2015,
	abstract = {Purpose Access to critical care is a crucial component of healthcare systems. In low-income countries, the burden of critical illness is substantial, but the capacity to provide care for critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is unknown. Our aim was to systematically review the published literature to estimate the current ICU capacity in low-income countries. Methods We searched 11 databases and included studies of any design, published 2004-August 2014, with data on ICU capacity for pediatric and adult patients in 36 low-income countries (as defined by World Bank criteria; population 850 million). Neonatal, temporary, and military ICUs were excluded. We extracted data on ICU bed numbers, capacity for mechanical ventilation, and information about the hospital, including referral population size, public accessibility, and the source of funding. Analyses were descriptive. Results Of 1,759 citations, 43 studies from 15 low-income countries met inclusion criteria. They described 36 individual ICUs in 31 cities, of which 16 had population greater than 500,000, and 14 were capital cities. The median annual ICU admission rate was 401 (IQR 234-711; 24 ICUs with data) and median ICU size was 8 beds (IQR 5-10; 32 ICUs with data). The mean ratio of adult and pediatric ICU beds to hospital beds was 1.5\% (SD 0.9\%; 15 hospitals with data). Nepal and Uganda, the only countries with national ICU bed data, had 16.7 and 1.0 ICU beds per million population, respectively. National data from other countries were not available. Conclusions Low-income countries lack ICU beds, and more than 50\% of these countries lack any published data on ICU capacity. Most ICUs in low-income countries are located in large referral hospitals in cities. A central database of ICU resources is required to evaluate health system performance, both within and between countries, and may help to develop related health policy.},

@article{gooch_icu_2014,
	abstract = {Intensive care is a substantial financial burden on the US health care system, with spending on critical illness exceeding \$80 billion per year, approximately 3\% of all health care spending and nearly 1\% of the gross domestic product. In contrast, the United Kingdom spends only 0.1\% of its gross domestic product on critical care services, with no evidence of worse patient outcomes and similar life expectancies as in the United States. Although there are many differences between these 2 countries, one significant difference is intensive care unit (ICU) bed supply. The United States has 25 ICU beds per 100 000 people, as compared with 5 per 100 000 in the United Kingdom. As a result, ICU case-mix differs substantially. In the United Kingdom, the majority of ICU patients are at high risk for death, whereas in the United States, many patients are admitted to the ICU for observation. At the same time, compared with patients in the United Kingdom, substantially more patients in the United States die in the ICU, suggesting that increased bed availability appears to reduce the incentive to keep dying patients out of the ICU.},

@article{yarkoni_generalizability_2022,
	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned -- that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology -- the linear mixed model -- I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the ``random effect'' formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

@article{shortland_choice_2020,
	abstract = {Individuals responsible for decision-making during critical incidents must wrestle with uncertainty, complexity, time pressure, and accountability. Critical incidents are defined as rare events where demand outstrips resources and where there are high stakes, uncertainty, and dynamic and ever-shifting elements that frustrate clear predictions. This paper argues that critical-incident decision-making is highly complex because many critical incidents have no such analogue, and thus there is no prior experience to draw upon. Further, while prescriptive models argue for a selection of a ``best'' outcome, rarely in critical incidents is there a ``best'' outcome and, instead, more likely a ``least-worst'' one. Most options are high risk, most will carry negative consequences, and many will be immutable and irreversible once committed to. This paper analyzes data collected from critical decision method interviews with members of the United States Armed Forces to explore the psychological processes of making (or not making) least-worst decisions in high-consequence situations. Specifically, and based on thematic analysis of interviews with those who have made least-worst decisions while serving as part of the Armed Forces, we identify a host of exogenous (external to the incident such as resources, political agendas) and endogenous factors (features of the incident itself---size, scale, duration) that affect the decision-making process. These factors have, to date, not been factored into theoretical models of how high-stakes decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {To improve the effectiveness of air combat decision-making systems, target intention has been extensively studied. In general, aerial target intention is composed of attack, surveillance, penetration, feint, defense, reconnaissance, cover and electronic interference and it is related to the state of a target in air combat. Predicting the target intention is helpful to know the target actions in advance. Thus, intention prediction has contributed to lay a solid foundation for air combat decision-making. In this work, an intention prediction method is developed, which combines the advantages of the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and decision tree. The future state information of a target is predicted based on LSTM networks from real-time series data, and the decision tree technology is utilized to extract rules from uncertain and incomplete priori knowledge. Then, the target intention is obtained from the predicted data by applying the built decision tree. With a simulation example, the results show that the proposed method is effective and feasible for state prediction and intention recognition of aerial targets under uncertain and incomplete information. Furthermore, the proposed method can make contributions in providing direction and aids for subsequent attack decision-making.},

@article{hechtlinger_psychology_2024,
	abstract = {Research on judgment and decision making typically studies ``small worlds''---highly simplified and stylized tasks such as monetary gambles---among homogenous populations rather than big real-life decisions made by people around the globe. These transformative life decisions (e.g., whether or not to emigrate or flee a country, disclose one's sexual orientation, get divorced, or report a sexual assault) can shape lives. This article argues that rather than reducing such consequential decisions to fit small-world models, researchers need to analyze their real-world properties. Drawing on principles of bounded and ecological rationality, it proposes a framework that identifies five dimensions of transformative life decisions: conflicting cues, change of self, uncertain experiential value, irreversibility, and risk. The framework also specifies simple, versatile choice strategies that address these dimensions by, for instance, breaking down a decision into steps, avoiding trade-offs between present and future selves, or sampling others' experiences. Finally, it suggests benchmarks for assessing the rationality of transformative life decisions. Methodologically, this framework adapts a long tradition of mainly lab-based judgment and decision-making research to a text-based approach, thereby setting the stage for empirical work that analyzes real-world decisions using natural-language processing. Only by understanding decisions with the potential to transform life trajectories---and people in the process---will it be possible to develop encompassing and inclusive theories of human decision making.

	abstract = {Studies suggest that young children are quite limited in their knowledge about cognitive phenomena---or in their metacognition---and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises. Metacognitive knowledge is one's stored knowledge or beliefs about oneself and others as cognitive agents, about tasks, about actions or strategies, and about how all these interact to affect the outcomes of any sort of intellectual enterprise. Metacognitive experiences are conscious cognitive or affective experiences that occur during the enterprise and concern any aspect of it---often, how well it is going. Research is needed to describe and explain spontaneous developmental acquisitions in this area and find effective ways of teaching metacognitive knowledge and cognitive monitoring skills.

@article{schmidt_acquiring_1993,
	abstract = {This article presents a new theory of expertise development in medicine and the empirical evidence available. This theory describes expertise development as the progression through a series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized by functionally different knowledge structures underlying performance. The first phase is characterized by the accumulation of causal knowledge about disease and its consequences. Through experience with real cases, this knowledge transforms into narrative structures called illness scripts. The cognitive mechanisms responsible for this transition are: Encapsulation of elaborated knowledge into high level but simplified causal models or even diagnostic categories and tuning through the inclusion of contextual information. The third phase is characterized by the use of episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of new cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process. These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any more in subsequent phases in the development of expertise, remain available for use when ontologically more recently acquired structures fail to produce an adequate representation of a clinical problem.},

@article{caddick_cognitive_2023,
	abstract = {Over the course of training, physicians develop significant knowledge and expertise. We review dual-process theory, the dominant theory in explaining medical decision making: physicians use both heuristics from accumulated experience (System 1) and logical deduction (System 2). We then discuss how the accumulation of System 1 clinical experience can have both positive effects (e.g., quick and accurate pattern recognition) and negative ones (e.g., gaps and biases in knowledge from physicians' idiosyncratic clinical experience). These idiosyncrasies, biases, and knowledge gaps indicate a need for individuals to engage in appropriate training and study to keep these cognitive skills current lest they decline over time. Indeed, we review converging evidence that physicians further out from training tend to perform worse on tests of medical knowledge and provide poorer patient care. This may reflect a variety of factors, such as specialization of a physician's practice, but is likely to stem at least in part from cognitive factors. Acquired knowledge or skills gained may not always be readily accessible to physicians for a number of reasons, including an absence of study, cognitive changes with age, and the presence of other similar knowledge or skills that compete in what is brought to mind. Lastly, we discuss the cognitive challenges of keeping up with standards of care that continuously evolve over time.},

	abstract = {Is self-assessment enough to keep physicians' cognitive skills---such as diagnosis, treatment, basic biological knowledge, and communicative skills---current? We review the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of self-assessment in the context of maintaining medical expertise. Cognitive science supports the importance of accurately self-assessing one's own skills and abilities, and we review several ways such accuracy can be quantified. However, our review also indicates a broad challenge in self-assessment is that individuals do not have direct access to the strength or quality of their knowledge and instead must infer this from heuristic strategies. These heuristics are reasonably accurate in many circumstances, but they also suffer from systematic biases. For example, information that feels easy to process in the moment can lead individuals to overconfidence in their ability to remember it in the future. Another notable phenomenon is the Dunning--Kruger effect: the poorest performers in a domain are also the least accurate in self-assessment. Further, explicit instruction is not always sufficient to remove these biases. We discuss what these findings imply about when physicians' self-assessment can be useful and when it may be valuable to supplement with outside sources.},

@article{kloosterman_humans_2019,
	abstract = {Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation toward a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants' decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation toward target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2---6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8---12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. Alpha suppression in turn was linked to the output activity in visual cortex, as expressed through 59---100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation toward the decision bound that maximizes reward.},

@article{mcmillen_dynamics_2006,
	abstract = {We consider neurally based models for decision-making in the presence of noisy incoming data. The two-alternative forced-choice task has been extensively studied, and in that case it is known that mutually inhibited leaky integrators in which leakage and inhibition balance can closely approximate a drift--diffusion process that is the continuum limit of the optimal sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Here we study the performance of neural integrators in n⩾2 alternative choice tasks and relate them to a multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT) that is asymptotically optimal in the limit of vanishing error rates. While a simple race model can implement this `max-vs-next' MSPRT, it requires an additional computational layer, while absolute threshold crossing tests do not require such a layer. Race models with absolute thresholds perform relatively poorly, but we show that a balanced leaky accumulator model with an absolute crossing criterion can approximate a `max-vs-ave' test that is intermediate in performance between the absolute and max-vs-next tests. We consider free and fixed time response protocols, and show that the resulting mean reaction times under the former and decision times for fixed accuracy under the latter obey versions of Hick's law in the low error rate range, and we interpret this in terms of information gained. Specifically, we derive relationships of the forms log(n-1), log(n), or log(n+1) depending on error rates, signal-to-noise ratio, and the test itself. We focus on linearized models, but also consider nonlinear effects of neural activities (firing rates) that are bounded below and show how they modify Hick's law.},

Diagnostic error compromises the integrity of the healthcare system, as it causes adverse patient outcomes, increased cost, and decreased patient satisfaction. Health care providers are trusted with the task of accurately diagnosing and treating patient's medical conditions, however, the process of arriving at an accurate diagnosis is much more daunting than one may assume. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic process in conjunction with the complex health care system, errors occur. Increasing the accuracy of the diagnostic process will improve patient outcomes, decrease health care costs, and increase patient satisfaction, yet the question remains, how can the clinician assure accurate diagnosis?

@article{cox_role_2024,
	abstract = {Background  Safety-n- etting is intended to protect against harm from uncertainty in diagnosis/disease trajectory. Despite recommendations to communicate diagnostic uncertainty when safety--netting, this is not always done. Aims  To explore how and why doctors safety-n- etted in response to several clinical scenarios, within the broader context of exploring how doctors communicate diagnostic uncertainty.
Methods  Doctors working in internal medical specialties (n=36) from five hospitals were given vignettes in a randomised order (all depicting different clinical scenarios involving diagnostic uncertainty). After reading each, they told an interviewer what they would tell a 'typical patient' in this situation. A follow-u- p semistructured interview explored reasons for their communication. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded. We examined how participants safety-n- etted using a content analysis approach, and why they safety-- netting with thematic analysis of the semistructured follow--up interviews using thematic analysis.
Results  We observed n=78 instances of safety-n- etting (across 108 vignette encounters). We found significant variation in how participants safety-n- etted. Safety--netting was common (although not universal), but clinicians differed in the detail provided about symptoms to be alert for, and the action advised. Although many viewed safety--netting as an important tool for managing diagnostic uncertainty, diagnostic uncertainty was infrequently explicitly discussed; most advised patients to return if symptoms worsened or new 'red flag' symptoms developed, but they rarely linked this directly to the possibility of diagnostic error. Some participants expressed concerns that communicating diagnostic uncertainty when safety--netting may cause anxiety for patients or could drive inappropriate reattendance/over-- investigation.
Conclusions  Participants safety-n- etted variously, even when presented with identical clinical information. Although safety-n- etting was seen as important in avoiding diagnostic error, concerns about worrying patients may have limited discussion about diagnostic uncertainty. Research is needed to determine whether communicating diagnostic uncertainty makes safety-- netting more effective at preventing harm associated with diagnostic error, and whether it causes significant patient anxiety.},

@article{simpkin_stress_2018,
	abstract = {Background
Depression and burnout are highly prevalent among residents, but little is known about modifiable personality variables, such as resilience and stress from uncertainty, that may predispose to these conditions. Residents are routinely faced with uncertainty when making medical decisions.
Objective
To determine how stress from uncertainty is related to resilience among pediatric residents and whether these attributes are associated with depression and burnout.
Methods
We surveyed 86 residents in pediatric residency programs from 4 urban freestanding children's hospitals in North America in 2015. Stress from uncertainty was measured with the use of the Physicians' Reaction to Uncertainty Scale, resilience with the use of the 14-item Resilience Scale, depression with the use of the Harvard National Depression Screening Scale; and burnout with the use of single-item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization from the Maslach Burnout Inventory.
Results
Fifty out of 86 residents responded to the survey (58.1\%). Higher levels of stress from uncertainty correlated with lower resilience (r = −0.60; P {\textless} .001). Five residents (10\%) met depression criteria and 15 residents (31\%) met burnout criteria. Depressed residents had higher mean levels of stress due to uncertainty (51.6 $\pm$ 9.1 vs 38.7 $\pm$ 6.7; P {\textless} .001) and lower mean levels of resilience (56.6 $\pm$ 10.7 vs 85.4 $\pm$ 8.0; P {\textless} .001) compared with residents who were not depressed. Burned out residents also had higher mean levels of stress due to uncertainty (44.0 $\pm$ 8.5 vs 38.3 $\pm$ 7.1; P = .02) and lower mean levels of resilience (76.7 $\pm$ 14.8 vs 85.0 $\pm$ 9.77; P = .02) compared with residents who were not burned out.
Conclusions
We found high levels of stress from uncertainty, and low levels of resilience were strongly correlated with depression and burnout. Efforts to enhance tolerance of uncertainty and resilience among residents may provide opportunities to mitigate resident depression and burnout.},

@article{custers_medical_2013,
	abstract = {Recently, human reasoning, problem solving, and decision making have been viewed as products of two separate systems: ``System 1,'' the unconscious, intuitive, or nonanalytic system, and ``System 2,'' the conscious, analytic, or reflective system. This view has penetrated the medical education literature, yet the idea of two independent dichotomous cognitive systems is not entirely without problems.
          This article outlines the difficulties of this ``two-system view'' and presents an alternative, developed by K.R. Hammond and colleagues, called cognitive continuum theory (CCT). CCT is featured by three key assumptions. First, human reasoning, problem solving, and decision making can be arranged on a cognitive continuum, with pure intuition at one end, pure analysis at the other, and a large middle ground called ``quasirationality.'' Second, the nature and requirements of the cognitive task, as perceived by the person performing the task, determine to a large extent whether a task will be approached more intuitively or more analytically. Third, for optimal task performance, this approach needs to match the cognitive properties and requirements of the task. Finally, the author makes a case that CCT is better able than a two-system view to describe medical problem solving and clinical reasoning and that it provides clear clues for how to organize training in clinical reasoning.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in their performance on both multiple-choice and open-ended medical reasoning examinations, but it remains unknown whether the use of such tools improves physician diagnostic reasoning.To assess the effect of an LLM on physicians' diagnostic reasoning compared with conventional resources.A single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 29 to December 29, 2023. Using remote video conferencing and in-person participation across multiple academic medical institutions, physicians with training in family medicine, internal medicine, or emergency medicine were recruited.Participants were randomized to either access the LLM in addition to conventional diagnostic resources or conventional resources only, stratified by career stage. Participants were allocated 60 minutes to review up to 6 clinical vignettes.The primary outcome was performance on a standardized rubric of diagnostic performance based on differential diagnosis accuracy, appropriateness of supporting and opposing factors, and next diagnostic evaluation steps, validated and graded via blinded expert consensus. Secondary outcomes included time spent per case (in seconds) and final diagnosis accuracy. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. A secondary exploratory analysis evaluated the standalone performance of the LLM by comparing the primary outcomes between the LLM alone group and the conventional resource group.Fifty physicians (26 attendings, 24 residents; median years in practice, 3 [IQR, 2-8]) participated virtually as well as at 1 in-person site. The median diagnostic reasoning score per case was 76\% (IQR, 66\%-87\%) for the LLM group and 74\% (IQR, 63\%-84\%) for the conventional resources-only group, with an adjusted difference of 2 percentage points (95\% CI, −4 to 8 percentage points; P = .60). The median time spent per case for the LLM group was 519 (IQR, 371-668) seconds, compared with 565 (IQR, 456-788) seconds for the conventional resources group, with a time difference of −82 (95\% CI, −195 to 31; P = .20) seconds.  The LLM alone scored 16 percentage points (95\% CI, 2-30 percentage points; P = .03) higher than the conventional resources group.In this trial, the availability of an LLM to physicians as a diagnostic aid did not significantly improve clinical reasoning compared with conventional resources. The LLM alone demonstrated higher performance than both physician groups, indicating the need for technology and workforce development to realize the potential of physician-artificial intelligence collaboration in clinical practice.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06157944},

@article{dave_interventions_2022,
	abstract = {Background Incorrect, delayed and missed diagnoses can contribute to significant adverse health outcomes. Intervention options have proliferated in recent years necessitating an update to McDonald et al's 2013 systematic review of interventions to reduce diagnostic error.
Objectives (1) To describe the types of published interventions for reducing diagnostic error that have been evaluated in terms of an objective patient outcome; (2) to assess the risk of bias in the included interventions and perform a sensitivity analysis of the findings; and (3) to determine the effectiveness of included interventions with respect to their intervention type.
Methods MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. Publications were included if they delivered patient-related outcomes relating to diagnostic accuracy, management outcomes and/or morbidity and mortality. The interventions in each included study were categorised and analysed using the six intervention types described by McDonald et al (technique, technology-based system interventions, educational interventions, personnel changes, structured process changes and additional review methods).
Results Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen of the 20 included studies (including three randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) demonstrated improvements in objective patient outcomes following the intervention. These three RCTs individually evaluated a technique-based intervention, a technology-based system intervention and a structured process change. The inclusion or exclusion of two higher risk of bias studies did not affect the results.
Conclusion Technique-based interventions, technology-based system interventions and structured process changes have been the most studied interventions over the time period of this review and hence are seen to be effective in reducing diagnostic error. However, more high-quality RCTs are required, particularly evaluating educational interventions and personnel changes, to demonstrate the value of these interventions in diverse settings.},

@article{vaccaro_when_2024,
	abstract = {Inspired by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment humans, researchers have studied human--AI systems involving different tasks, systems and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human--AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human--AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges' g = −0.23; 95\% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human--AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human--AI systems.},

@article{wolpaw_student_2012,
	abstract = {Purpose 
          To compare the nature of uncertainties expressed by medical students using the six-step SNAPPS technique for case presentations (Summarize history and findings; N{\textgreater}arrow the differential; Analyze the differential; Probe preceptors about uncertainties; Plan management; Select case-related issues for self-study) versus those expressed by students doing customary presentations and to elucidate how preceptors respond.
          Method 
          The authors performed a secondary analysis in 2009 of data from a 2004--2005 randomized study, comparing SNAPPS users' case presentations with other students' presentations. Authors coded transcriptions of audiotaped presentations to family medicine preceptors for type of student uncertainties, nature of preceptor responses, alignment of preceptor responses with uncertainty types, and expansion of preceptors' responses beyond addressing uncertainties.
          Results 
          The analysis included 19 SNAPPS and 41 comparison presentations. SNAPPS students expressed uncertainties in all case presentations, nearly twice as many as the comparison group (χ21df = 12.89, P = .0001). Most SNAPPS users' uncertainties (24/44 [55\%]) focused on diagnostic reasoning compared with 9/38 (24\%) for comparison students' (χ21df = 8.08, P = .004). Uncertainties about clinical findings and medications/management did not differ significantly between groups. Preceptors responded with teaching aligned with the uncertainties and expanded 24/66 (36\%) of their comments.
          Conclusion 
          Students can drive the content of the teaching they receive based on uncertainties they express to preceptors during case presentations. Preceptors are ready to teach at ``the drop of a question'' and align their teaching with the content of students' questions; these learning moments---in context and just-in-time---can be created by students.},

@article{manohar_attention_2013,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}What is the purpose of attention? One avenue of research has led to the proposal that attention might be crucial for gathering information about the environment, while other lines of study have demonstrated how attention may play a role in guiding behavior to rewarded options. Many experiments that study attention require participants to make a decision based on information acquired discretely at one point in time. In real-world situations, however, we are usually not presented with information about which option to select in such a manner. Rather we must initially search for information, weighing up reward values of options before we commit to a decision. Here, we propose that attention plays a role in both foraging for information {\textless}italic{\textgreater}and{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} foraging for value. When foraging for information, attention is guided toward the unknown. When foraging for reward, attention is guided toward high reward values, allowing decision-making to proceed by accept-or-reject decisions on the currently attended option. According to this account, attention can be regarded as a low-cost alternative to moving around and physically interacting with the environment---``{\textless}italic{\textgreater}tele{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}foraging''---before a decision is made to interact physically with the world. To track the timecourse of attention, we asked participants to seek out and acquire information about two gambles by directing their gaze, before choosing one of them. Participants often made multiple refixations on items before making a decision. Their eye movements revealed that early in the trial, attention was guided toward information, i.e., toward locations that reduced uncertainty about value. In contrast, late in the trial, attention was guided by expected value of the options. At the end of the decision period, participants were generally attending to the item they eventually chose. We suggest that attentional foraging shifts from an uncertainty-driven to a reward-driven mode during the evolution of a decision, permitting decisions to be made by an engage-or-search strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{kostopoulou_predictors_2008,
	abstract = {Objective. To investigate the role of information gathering and clinical experience on the diagnosis and management of difficult diagnostic problems in family medicine.Method.Seven diagnostic scenarios including 1 to 4 predetermined features of difficulty were constructed and presented on a computer to 84 physicians: 21 residents in family medicine, 21 family physicians with 1 to 3 y in practice, and 42 family physicians with ≥10 y in practice. Following the Active Information Search process tracing approach, participants were initially presented with a patient description and presenting complaint and were subsequently able to request further information to diagnose and manage the patient. Evidence-based scoring criteria for information gathering, diagnosis, and management were derived from the literature and a separate study of expert opinion.Results.Rates of misdiagnosis were in accordance with the number of features of difficulty. Seventy-eight percent of incorrect diagnoses were followed by inappropriate management and 92\% of correct diagnoses by appropriate management. Number of critical cues requested (cues diagnostic of any relevant differential diagnoses in a scenario) was a significant predictor of accuracy in 6 scenarios: 1 additional critical cue increased the odds of obtaining the correct diagnosis by between 1.3 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0---1.8) and 7.5 (95\% CI, 3.2--- 17.7), depending on the scenario. No effect of experience was detected on either diagnostic accuracy or management. Residents requested significantly more cues than experienced family physicians did.Conclusions. Supporting the gathering of critical information has the potential to improve the diagnosis and management of difficult problems in family medicine.},

When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

@misc{fischer_intellectual_2024,
	abstract = {Intellectual humility is increasingly recognized as an epistemic virtue that helps foster truth-seeking, encourage compromise, and mitigate polarization. Yet, the current body of evidence grapples with a striking contradiction: The prevailing theoretical account suggests that intellectual humility hinges on metacognitive ability---the capacity to introspect on one's own accuracy which manifests in assigning due confidence to the varying accuracy of one's accuracy. However, empirical research testing this metacognitive ability account of intellectual humility has yielded inconsistent results. Here, we introduce a cognitive science approach informed by Signal Detection Theory, allowing for a more nuanced separation of metacognitive ability from correlated but distinct concepts (i.e., confidence and accuracy). We conduct a survey study among a national US sample (N = 999) involving the interpretation of one of the most heavily contested domains---climate change---lending itself for an investigation into how intellectual humility relates to cognitive processes in domains where it is most needed. We presented participants with summaries of fictitious studies on renewable energy, followed by 2-alternative forced choice questions to assess their accuracy and confidence. Results showed that firstly, more intellectually humble citizens were more accurate at discerning correct from incorrect interpretations of the presented evidence. Secondly, more intellectually humble citizens exhibited a heightened capacity to adjust their confidence levels to the varying accuracy of their evidence interpretations--indicating higher metacognitive ability---and this association was robust to accounting for their superior accuracy, and other preregistered covariates. And thirdly, in contrast to intuitive notions, more intellectually humble citizens did not exhibit lower metacognitive bias, the inclination to report lower (vs. higher) overall confidence. By highlighting the role of metacognitive ability in intellectual humility, the current study delivers empirical evidence for the ancient notion that epistemic virtues are linked to metacognitive ability.},

	abstract = {Information gathering is a foundational step of the diagnostic process.1 It is not possible to synthesise clinical information to make a correct diagnosis without adequate data collection related to a patient's history, physical examination, test results or consultations with other clinicians. However, evidence over the last several decades suggests that failures in information gathering are common and feature prominently in analyses of diagnostic errors.2--7 Many information-gathering failures are related to history taking, including asking the right questions, which is sometimes based on certain cues from the patient.

In this issue of BMJ Quality and Safety , Sheringham et al 8 used simulated patient vignettes to understand the role that patient characteristics (including demographics and symptomatology) play in physicians' decisions to investigate for possible diagnosis of lung cancer. They found that despite suggestive initial symptoms, general practitioners (GPs) failed to elicit additional key symptoms from `patients' that would have suggested the need to investigate further through ordering of tests (chest X-rays or CT scans) or referral to a respiratory consultant. GPs were more likely to initiate investigations when they elicited these additional symptoms that the `patient' had, but did not initially volunteer. The omission of symptom elicitation persisted even in patients with higher risk of lung cancer. While the authors found patient characteristics, such as race and age, related to GPs' investigational behaviours, these factors only accounted for a small proportion of failures to investigate.

What then can explain these differences in information gathering by GPs? In real-world practice, one of the usual suspects is insufficient time,9 which we ourselves have implicated before.3 However, in this study, there was no specific time restriction on the GPs, suggesting we must seek additional reasons. In the real world, physicians sometimes have difficulty in extracting relevant historical data from the {\ldots}},

	abstract = {An accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) is a cornerstone of medical care, often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to both assist and automate aspects of this process. In this study, we introduce an LLM optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a DDx alone or as an aid to clinicians. 20 clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: either assistance from search engines and standard medical resources, or LLM assistance in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted DDx prior to using the respective assistive tools. Our LLM for DDx exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1\% vs 33.6\%, [p = 0.04]). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the DDx quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by our LLM (top-10 accuracy 51.7\%) compared to clinicians without its assistance (36.1\%) (McNemar's Test: 45.7, p {\textless} 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4\%) (4.75, p = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by our LLM arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without its assistance. Our study suggests that our LLM for DDx has potential to improve clinicians' diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients' access to specialist-level expertise.},

	abstract = {The inability of large language models (LLMs) to communicate uncertainty is a significant barrier to their use in medicine. Before LLMs can be integrated into patient care, the field must assess methods to estimate uncertainty in ways that are useful to physician-users.Evaluate the ability for uncertainty proxies to quantify LLM confidence when performing diagnosis and treatment selection tasks by assessing the properties of discrimination and calibration.We examined confidence elicitation (CE), token-level probability (TLP), and sample consistency (SC) proxies across GPT3.5, GPT4, Llama2, and Llama3. Uncertainty proxies were evaluated against 3 datasets of open-ended patient scenarios.SC discrimination outperformed TLP and CE methods. SC by sentence embedding achieved the highest discriminative performance (ROC AUC 0.68-0.79), yet with poor calibration. SC by GPT annotation achieved the second-best discrimination (ROC AUC 0.66-0.74) with accurate calibration. Verbalized confidence (CE) was found to consistently overestimate model confidence.SC is the most effective method for estimating LLM uncertainty of the proxies evaluated. SC by sentence embedding can effectively estimate uncertainty if the user has a set of reference cases with which to re-calibrate their results, while SC by GPT annotation is the more effective method if the user does not have reference cases and requires accurate raw calibration. Our results confirm LLMs are consistently over-confident when verbalizing their confidence (CE).},

	abstract = {Introduction: A recent review of the physician performance literature concluded that the risk of prematurely closing one's diagnostic search increases with years of experience. To minimize confounding variables and gain insight into cognitive issues relevant to continuing education, the current study was performed to test this conclusion. Methods: Physician participants were shown a series of case histories and asked to judge the probability of a pair of diagnoses. The order in which features were presented was manipulated across participants and the probabilities compared to determine the impact of information order. Two groups of participants were recruited, 1 older than and 1 younger than 60 years. Results: The probability assigned to a diagnosis tended to be greater when features consistent with that diagnosis preceded those consistent with an alternative than when the same features followed those consistent with the alternative. Older participants revealed a greater primacy effect than less experienced participants across 4 experimental conditions. Discussion: Physicians with greater experience appear to weigh their first impressions more heavily than those with less experience. Educators should design instructional activities that account for experience-specific cognitive tendencies.},

	abstract = {When knowledge is scarce, it is adaptive to seek further information to resolve uncertainty and obtain a more accurate worldview. Biases in such information-seeking behavior can contribute to the maintenance of inaccurate views. Here, we investigate whether predispositions for uncertainty-guided information seeking relate to individual differences in dogmatism, a phenomenon linked to entrenched beliefs in political, scientific, and religious discourse. We addressed this question in a perceptual decision-making task, allowing us to rule out motivational factors and isolate the role of uncertainty. In two independent general population samples (n = 370 and n = 364), we show that more dogmatic participants are less likely to seek out new information to refine an initial perceptual decision, leading to a reduction in overall belief accuracy despite similar initial decision performance. Trial-by-trial modeling revealed that dogmatic participants placed less reliance on internal signals of uncertainty (confidence) to guide information search, rendering them less likely to seek additional information to update beliefs derived from weak or uncertain initial evidence. Together, our results highlight a cognitive mechanism that may contribute to the formation of dogmatic worldviews.},

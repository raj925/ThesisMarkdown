Stage of the Diagnostic Process,Description,Associated Study Findings
1. Initial Differential Generation,"Clinicians take a history of the patient that, based on past experience with patients and knowledge of prototypical (or 'textbook') cases of certain condition, bringing to a mind an initial set of differentials.","Medical students' initial diagnostic breadth is predictive of subsequent information seeking and changes in confidence (Online Study, Figures 3.6A and 3.6B, Chapter 3)"
1. Initial Differential Generation,"Clinicians take a history of the patient that, based on past experience with patients and knowledge of prototypical (or 'textbook') cases of certain condition, bringing to a mind an initial set of differentials.","Medical students report a tendency toward gradual investigation that builds on the patient history (Think-aloud Study, Thematic Analysis section 'Heuristics when Making Diagnostic Decisions', Chapter 4)"
1. Initial Differential Generation,"Clinicians take a history of the patient that, based on past experience with patients and knowledge of prototypical (or 'textbook') cases of certain condition, bringing to a mind an initial set of differentials.","Medical students made more appropriate diagnoses when seeking more useful information about the patient's medical history (VR Study, Figure 5.7, Chapter 5)"
2. Evaluation of Differentials,"Clinicians then seek information that often leads to the broadening of differentials that they are considering, such that they aim to consider a wide enough range of potential hypotheses for the patient's condition.","Medical students tended to broaden the differentials they were considering with more information (Online Study, Figure 3.5, Chapter 3 and Think-Aloud Study, Figure 4.1A Chapter 4)"
2. Evaluation of Differentials,"Clinicians then seek information that often leads to the broadening of differentials that they are considering, such that they aim to consider a wide enough range of potential hypotheses for the patient's condition.","Medical students reported an awareness of the importance of being open-minded when considering new differentials (Think-aloud Study, Thematic Analysis section 'Avoidance of Anchoring', Chapter 4)"
3. Reaching a Diagnosis,"After reaching a point of (perceived) sufficient evaluation, clinicians then seek to either narrow their set of differentials or adopt a 'pattern recognition' approach based on their broad set of differentials. They do this by seeking either directed hypothesis-driven tests or by beginning certain kinds of treatment. The feedback from both (in terms of the patient's reaction in the latter case) are then used to determine a narrower set of differentials (or a single differential) to focus on as a 'primary diagnosis'. Other differentials may be simultaneously considered by clinicians as secondary (or, in the back of their mind), but this tends not to exceed three or four differentials.","In a scenario where a patient could be treated, medical students tended to narrow the differentials that they were considering as they administered more treatment. (VR Study, Figure 5.5, Chapter 5)"

p1,"“I try to go based on kind of...the stock, that kind of differentials I have for the different presentations and then work down, kind of trying to narrow it down with further information and kind of rule out certain things in my head.”",HD,I generate differentials based on the patient presentation and then narrow those down,Process of elimination 
p2,"“Yeah, I think I would like to say that I would think about different systems and stuff, but I think I'm a bit more frantic...I'm not sure if I have a specific approach, I think I just wait for something into pop into my head, really, which is quite bad.”",PR,I would like to be more structured but I tend to wait for a diagnosis to come to mind based on the information I have,Matching information with most likely diagnosis
p3,"“But yeah, I definitely, like, often have an idea from the start. I think I probably do think about that the whole way through, which probably can be beneficial, but can also sometimes hold me back from looking at other options.”",PR,"Early differential used to guide rest of the diagnostic process, not much consideration of alternative diagnoses",Seeking information in favour of a single diagnosis
p4,"“So going through like a system of starting with the history and sort of gathering as much information as I can there and thinking already what I think might be happening, and then examining them and seeing if that sort of changed anything, but then sort of getting investigations. And yeah, basically, I like to sort of, yeah, piece everything together, sort of, as I get information, and then sort of try to reach a diagnosis that I think might be going on sort of at the at the end of that...I think probably, especially as a medical students, we get taught to rule out like red flag stuff. So like a lot of my thinking is like, what like really worrying thing could this be that we need to rule out? And what tests do I need to rule it out? But then also like when I'm thinking or what could this be, I'm also thinking about what investigations would help me to conclusively reach a diagnosis that this is what it is once I think I know what's going on.”",HD,"Seek as much information as possible to find what differentials are likely but also what differentials need to be ruled out. Based on what is ruled out, I can decide what is most likely. ",Focus on ruling out differentials to find what is likely and what is potentially serious
p5,"“But I think most of the time I try and keep quite a broad set of ideas. And then narrow it down and try and think, like, system wise...like the one that was aortic dissection, that I was sort of like, this sounds like they're coming with abdo pain, but it could be something cardiac, it could be something like...trying to keep ruling out systems.”",SI,Keeping broad set of ideas based on the possible systems that could be implicated in the presenting complaint and then ruling systems out,Structuring diagnosis by what pathophysiological systems can be ruled out
p6,"“I think we need to rule out differentials, but I felt like a lot of points, I felt like this is the most likely but I still feel like I want to rule everything else out first...But also for the last one I especially, I have a very strong feeling it was GCA. Therefore I wasn't as keen to broaden my differentials.”",PR,"Ruling out differentials is important, but there tends to be a primary diagnosis that comes to mind","Focal diagnosis tends to come to mind, though some ruling out of differentials is also necessary"
p7,"“So after taking a history, as long as the patient's not like acutely unwell, taking history and accurate family history, and their past medical history, creating a sort of list of most likely differentials in my head, and then seeing what would be useful in ruling some of those in and out.”",HD,Generate a list of differentials first based on patient history and then decide what information is needed to either support or rule them out,Work from an initial set of differentials to guide information seeking
p8,"“Trying to go from their main symptom and then trying to bring up general, maybe not specific conditions, but kind of what can go wrong that would lead to this picture...I think my brain can sometimes get stuck on an idea. And it's difficult to pull away from that.”",PR,"Think about what comes to mind based on the initial presentation, can be influenced by an early idea of what the patient has, less focused on specific conditions to rule out",Generate a general diagnosis based on what comes to mind from early patient presentation
p9,"“Either spot diagnosis if it's a really typical case, like otherwise, basically, if I'm not sure I'll work through a surgical sieve.”",PR,Come up with an idea for a diagnosis on the spot or go through a structured process if not sure,Default is to match the current patient to what comes to mind as a prototypical case
p10,"“I guess, trying to go from their main symptom and then trying to bring up general, maybe not specific conditions, but kind of what can go wrong that would lead to this picture. And then trying to rule in or out things that fit with that...Like, if someone's coming in with a presentation that could be quite urgent and serious, then obviously you want to rule out like a stroke, you want to rule that out quite quickly.”",HD,"From the symptom, generate a set of differentials that could create this picture in the patient, then rule in and out from this set",Initial set of differentials to rule in or out 
p11,"“I guess you've always got to think about two things. What's common? And what do we have to rule out?... even just to rule out a few more things that perhaps then you don't even have to test for and consider later, if you've ruled them out in history.”",HD,"Generate differentials based on what's common and what's severe if missed, rule some differentials out during history taking so you don't have to test for them later","From an initial set of differentials, work on ruling some out as early as possible"
p12,"“Take a history, like detailed history, formulate my top differentials. And then basically, look at investigations and examinations to confirm or rule out these differentials or any that are sufficiently different? Consider different differentials.”",HD,"Generate a set of differentials based on a detailed history, seek information to rule them in or out",Work from an initial set of differentials to guide information seeking
p13,"“I try and think about the, like the different systems that might be involved before thinking about...so for example, if someone presents with chest pain, there's lots of things in the chest that could lead to chest pain. So try and think about the systems more generally and then focus on the specific symptoms that align with this specific system if that makes sense.”",SI,"Based on the presenting symptoms, I think about what pathophysiological systems might be causing them and then go from there",Primary focus on determining the system involved before thinking about specific conditions
p14,"“Just sort of work through from the most like, basic things like history and examination within like least invasive tests, and then try to work up from there. trying to rule out the most serious things...Like some things, you just have to get the differentials broad because there's so many things that could cause it.”",HD,"Rule out serious differentials, important to remain as broad as possible",Focus on remaining open minded and broad to rule differentials out
p15,"“But I think generally the big things are is there a system under which it generally falls? Primarily, like, does it sound haemotological, cardiac, whatever.”",SI,Trying to match symptoms to a particular pathophysiological system,Structures diagnosis by pathophysiological systems
p16,"“So probably getting history, I look at initial observations first...and then I look at ECG as well, then I want to get initial bloods being guided by what I think could be going on and then think about potential images. If it's quite obvious early on what's going on. And for example, it's some kind of infection, I'd want to start them on antibiotics early, but otherwise, I might get advice or wait until I get all my information, before starting treatments.”",PR,"Based on intial history and tests, see if it is obvious what is happening with the patient and if not, seek additional advice and information",Seek information until a clear diagnosis comes to mind matching the information

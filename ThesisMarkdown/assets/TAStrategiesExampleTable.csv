Participant (Case),Full Quote,Code/Strategy,Interpretation
p1 (AD),"""A long time ago she had a total hysterectomy, doesn't really tell me much. Although... why did she have that? Was that for cancer? Has that come back? She must have been quite young when that happened. So yeah, it would be worth investigating further...so I would need more investigations before knowing how to treat her in this case. So I'm not very confident at all. If this is an infection, if this is cardiac related, is it a PE? Yeah, it could be many things or is this malignancy? Yeah. So hopefully the exam will tell us more.""",HD,"Considering multiple diagnostic possibilities before starting physical examinations, naming specific conditions (e.g. PE) rather than simply focusing on pathophysiological systems "
p5 (UC),"""So I think diverticulitis is probably at the top of my differential, IBD would be up there. Infective gastroenteritis. I would also just be worried generally about his hydration status because it sounds like he's losing a lot of water.""",HD,"Explicit mention of a 'list' of differentials, with one at the top of consideration"
p3 (GBS),"""Reduced tone, reduced power, reduced coordination, reduced reflexes. Upper limbs normal. So it's looking like lower motor neuron given this reduced tone. And so could this lower motor neurone be something like Guillain Barre? What would cause that, would be sudden onset. Okay, but yeah, given that it's not upper motor neuron stroke.""",PR,"Use 'looks like' to denote pattern matching, points to a specific condition, mentions ruling out a previous differential before moving on to this current one."
p13 (MTB),"""Crackles on the right and left lower zones. So bilateral crackles could be congestive heart failure and then sounds like thereâ€™s maybe a pneumonia there with the crackles in the right middle zone.""",PR,"Uses 'sounds like' to denote pattern matching, provides two concurrent conditions as a single diagnosis rather than separate possibilities"
p8 (TTP),"""So the slurred speech, headache and weakness in the arms sounds neurological in origin. And his high blood pressure is concerning for such a young man...I don't have a definitive diagnosis. Now could be something infective or it could be something cardiac in origin.""",SI,"Mentions multiple pathophysiological systems that could be implicated, explicitly states that they do not have a definitive diagnosis"
p16 (TA),"""Wonder if this is an underlying rheumatology thing and this fever is something separate so let's just auscultate his lungs. Lungs are clear, get the heart. Okay neurological exam, normal, eyes, want to do abdo as well. Ok, fine so I think it's more of an infective picture but I don't know where the source of infection is...So testing, do CRP and ESR. CRP is raised, ESR is raised. So again could be rheumatological or infective.""",SI,"Weighing up two different groups of conditions that could be causing the patient's symptoms, but not mentioning specific conditions"
